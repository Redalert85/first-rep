5. STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Current State:

  Total Cards in System: 58
  Cards Due Now: 58

🎯 FIRST-TIME SETUP RECOMMENDATIONS:

Suggested Daily Review Targets:

  Conservative (30 cards/day):
    • Lower daily commitment, longer timeline
    • Time to first pass: ~1 days
    • Estimated daily time: ~60-90 minutes

  Balanced (50 cards/day):
    • Recommended for most students
    • Time to first pass: ~1 days
    • Estimated daily time: ~100-150 minutes

  Aggressive (75 cards/day):
    • For dedicated full-time study
    • Time to first pass: ~0 days
    • Estimated daily time: ~150-225 minutes

Priority Study Order:

  Phase 1: MBE Core Subjects
    • Civil Procedure (5 cards)
    • Constitutional Law (5 cards)
    • Contracts (5 cards)
    • Criminal Law (5 cards)
    • Evidence (5 cards)
    • Real Property (5 cards)
    • Torts (5 cards)

  Phase 2: Essay-Only Subjects
    • Criminal Procedure (5 cards)
    • Family Law (4 cards)
    • Corporations (3 cards)
    • Professional Responsibility (3 cards)
    • Secured Transactions (3 cards)
    • Wills, Trusts & Estates (3 cards)
    • Iowa Procedure (2 cards)

Optimal Study Schedule:

  ✓ Study at the same time daily (consistency is key)
  ✓ Morning sessions typically show better retention
  ✓ Take breaks every 25-30 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
  ✓ Review in multiple shorter sessions vs one long session
  ✓ Don't skip days - consistency beats intensity

Expected Timeline:

  • Week 1-2: Initial learning (cards will feel hard)
  • Week 3-4: Patterns emerge (concepts start connecting)
  • Week 5-6: Confidence builds (review intervals lengthen)
  • Week 7+: Mastery phase (most cards at long intervals)

General Study Tips:

  → Be honest with your ratings (quality 0-5)
  → Quality 3+ means you could explain it to someone
  → Don't be afraid to rate yourself low - it helps the algorithm
  → If you're consistently guessing, review the underlying concepts
  → Use mnemonic devices for lists and elements
