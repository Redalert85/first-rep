# MEMORANDUM

## ISSUE PRESENTED

If we offer confirmation of therapy type and attendance dates, does that open the door for opposing counsel to compel our client to turn over her mental health and substance abuse records?

## SHORT ANSWER

**Likely no under statutory privilege; constitutional privacy provides qualified backup protection requiring case-by-case balancing.**

A carefully limited confirmation—stating only treatment type and attendance dates, with no provider names, diagnoses, symptoms, clinical content, or progress claims—paired with an express non-waiver reservation and protective order, should not constitute waiver under Iowa Code § 622.10's statutory privilege.

**Gate 1 (Statutory Privilege):** Under *Ashenfelter v. Mulligan*, 792 N.W.2d 665, 675–76 (Iowa 2010), the statutory patient-litigant exception applies only when the privilege holder affirmatively makes their mental condition an element of their own claim or defense. Confirming treatment to rebut opponent's allegations is defensive denial, not affirmative placement. We disclose no confidential communications—only administrative facts (dates and type).

**Gate 2 (Constitutional Privacy—if reached):** Even if statutory privilege were found not to apply, Iowa's qualified constitutional privacy right provides a second layer of protection, but requires *McMaster* five-factor balancing. *Fagen v. Grand View Univ.*, 861 N.W.2d 825, 831, 834–35 (Iowa 2015), holds privacy is not absolute and courts must assess relevance, need, alternatives, patient interest, and public interest. In custody cases, child welfare may create compelling need, making Gate 1 critical.

**SUD Overlay:** For federally assisted substance use disorder treatment, 42 C.F.R. Part 2 prohibits disclosure of any patient-identifying information (including attendance) absent a compliant consent or court order meeting Subpart E's stringent requirements.

## GOVERNING LEGAL FRAMEWORK: TWO-GATE ANALYSIS

Iowa provides two independent but sequential layers of protection. We must win at Gate 1; Gate 2 is a qualified fallback that requires balancing and could be overcome in custody litigation.

### Gate 1: Statutory Privilege (Iowa Code § 622.10) — **PRIMARY DEFENSE**

#### Nature of Protection

Iowa Code § 622.10 creates statutory evidentiary privilege protecting confidential communications between patients and mental health professionals. *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 671–72. The privilege "must be liberally construed to accomplish its protective purposes." *Id.* at 675. Waiver, conversely, must be construed narrowly.

#### The Patient-Litigant Exception

The privilege does not apply when "the patient . . . introduces the patient's mental . . . condition as an element of the patient's claim or defense." Iowa Code § 622.10(2); *In re Marriage of Hutchinson*, 588 N.W.2d 442, 447 (Iowa 1999).

**Key Principle:** "*Denial of an element or factor of one's opponent's case does not make that element or factor part of the case of the person making the denial.*" *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 676 (emphasis added).

When opponent alleges unfitness due to untreated mental health or substance abuse issues and we deny it, **we have not made mental condition an element of our claim or defense.** The burden remains on opponent to prove their allegation.

#### Application: Defensive Denial vs. Affirmative Placement

- **Affirmative placement (waives privilege):** "My excellent mental health and successful therapy prove I am a fit parent." (Makes mental health an element of fitness claim.)

- **Defensive denial (no waiver):** "Opponent alleges I do not attend treatment. That is factually incorrect. I attend [type] treatment." (Rebuts opponent's allegation without making mental health a basis for custody claim.)

Confirming attendance is quintessential defensive denial.

#### Privileged Communications vs. Administrative Information

Iowa Code § 622.10(1) protects "*confidential communications*"—statements, clinical content, therapeutic exchanges between patient and provider.

We propose to disclose only **administrative facts**: treatment type and dates of attendance. No statements made by client to therapist; no clinical observations, diagnoses, or opinions; no treatment content.

Iowa Code § 228.1 (mental health confidentiality chapter) separately defines "administrative information" (including dates of service) as distinct from protected clinical content. While § 228.1 appears outside the privilege statute, the statutory distinction supports that Iowa law recognizes a difference between administrative facts and confidential therapeutic communications. Disclosing administrative facts alone does not disclose privileged communications.

#### Strategic Significance: No Balancing Required at Gate 1

**If we prevail on statutory privilege grounds, no balancing is required—the records are protected.** *Ashenfelter* suggested (though did not definitively hold) that balancing may not be appropriate when statutory privilege applies in civil cases. 792 N.W.2d at 673.

This is why Gate 1 is our primary and strongest argument. Winning here avoids the uncertainties of Gate 2 balancing.

### Gate 2: Constitutional Privacy — **QUALIFIED PROTECTION ONLY** (Apply Only If Gate 1 Fails)

#### Nature of Protection

Iowa recognizes a qualified constitutional right to privacy in mental health records under the Iowa Constitution, separate from and independent of statutory privilege. *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 672–73; *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 831.

#### **CRITICAL LIMITATION — Privacy Is Not Absolute**

*Fagen* expressly holds: "Patients have a constitutional right to privacy in medical records, but *the privilege is not absolute*. Rather, the privilege is qualified." 861 N.W.2d at 831 (citing *McMaster v. Iowa Bd. of Psychology Exam'rs*, 509 N.W.2d 754, 758–59 (Iowa 1993)) (emphasis added).

"*The privacy interest must always be weighed against such public interests as the societal need for information, and a compelling need for information may override the privacy interest.*" *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 831 (quoting *McMaster*, 509 N.W.2d at 759) (emphasis added in *Fagen*).

#### The McMaster Five-Factor Balancing Test

To determine whether constitutional privacy protection yields to disclosure, Iowa courts balance:

1. **Relevance** of the records sought to the case.
2. **Availability of alternative means** of obtaining the same information.
3. **Demonstrated need** for the information (party seeking records must show concrete, specific need; not speculative or fishing).
4. **Patient's privacy interest** in the records.
5. **Public interest** in disclosure vs. confidentiality.

*McMaster*, 509 N.W.2d at 759; *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 835.

#### Fagen Overlay: Specific Nexus, Alternatives, and Narrow Tailoring Required

*Fagen* refined *McMaster*'s application:

- **Specific nexus required:** Party seeking records must demonstrate a concrete connection between the particular records sought and a live element of the case. Conclusory or speculative assertions of relevance are insufficient. *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 834–35.

- **Alternatives must be exhausted or considered:** Before ordering disclosure, courts must assess whether the same information can be obtained through less intrusive means (e.g., independent examinations, interrogatories, stipulations). *Id.*

- **Narrow tailoring if any disclosure:** If balancing favors disclosure, production must be limited in scope and time, with redaction of unnecessary clinical content and protective orders preventing broader use. *Id.*

#### Threshold for In-Camera Review

No in-camera review should occur absent a **concrete, specific showing** by the moving party that the records are relevant and necessary. *State v. Howland*, No. 22-0519, 2023 WL 3613259, at \*3–5 (Iowa Ct. App. May 24, 2023) (reversing trial court's in-camera review where State failed to make threshold showing of relevance and need; holding that even in-camera review invades privacy and requires justification).

Opposing counsel must satisfy the *McMaster*/*Fagen* threshold **before** the court even looks at the records. This procedural protection is critical.

### Why Gate 2 Is a Weaker Fallback in Custody Cases

If we lose at Gate 1 (court finds § 622.10(2) patient-litigant exception applies), we fall back to Gate 2 constitutional privacy balancing. But this is not an absolute shield. The *McMaster*/*Fagen* balancing test presents vulnerabilities in custody context:

1. **Relevance factor weighs against us:** Treatment records have direct relevance to assessing current mental health stability, which courts consider relevant to parenting capacity under Iowa Code § 598.41(3)(i), (n).

2. **"Compelling need" argument is strong in custody:** *McMaster* holds that compelling societal need can override privacy. In *Fagen* (employment discrimination) and *McMaster* (board investigation), the competing interests were institutional/regulatory. Here, the competing interest is **child welfare**—which Iowa courts treat as paramount. Opponent will argue child's best interests create compelling need that overrides privacy.

3. **Public interest factor cuts both ways:** Public policy favors encouraging treatment-seeking (supporting privacy). But public policy also favors protecting children and ensuring custody decisions are fully informed (supporting disclosure). In custody cases, courts may find child protection interest outweighs treatment-seeking encouragement.

**Bottom line:** Constitutional privacy provides a safety net, not a solid wall. The balancing test could realistically go against us in custody litigation where child welfare is at stake. **This makes winning at Gate 1 (statutory privilege) critical.**

## SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OVERLAY: 42 C.F.R. PART 2 + IOWA CODE § 125.37

### Federal Part 2 Requirements

For federally assisted substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs, 42 C.F.R. Part 2 provides protections **more stringent** than state law and HIPAA. Part 2 prohibits disclosure of any "patient-identifying information"—which includes **even the fact that an individual attends a SUD program**—absent:

1. **Patient's written consent** meeting Part 2's strict requirements (42 C.F.R. § 2.31), or
2. **Court order** under Part 2 Subpart E (42 C.F.R. §§ 2.61–.67).

### Part 2-Compliant Consent (If Client Consents to Disclose Attendance)

Any written consent must:

- Identify the specific information to be disclosed: "**treatment type (substance use disorder counseling) and dates of attendance only; no diagnosis, clinical content, progress, assessments, or provider identity.**"
- State the purpose: "To rebut opposing party's allegation of non-treatment in custody case [case name/number]."
- Identify recipient: opposing counsel by name.
- State expiration: short, specific date (e.g., 30 days or conclusion of this motion).
- Include prohibition on redisclosure: "Recipient may not further disclose this information without additional Part 2-compliant consent or court order."
- Be signed and dated by client.

42 C.F.R. § 2.31.

### Part 2 Court Order Alternative (If No Consent)

If client declines consent, opposing counsel must obtain a court order under Part 2 Subpart E. The court must find:

1. **Good cause:** Other means insufficient; public interest and need outweigh privacy.
2. **Limited disclosure:** Order must limit disclosure to information necessary for the stated purpose.
3. **Limited use:** Order must restrict use to the case and prohibit redisclosure.
4. **Sealed proceedings:** Application and order must be sealed.

42 C.F.R. §§ 2.64, 2.65.

**Strategic point:** Opposing counsel likely will not satisfy Part 2's stringent requirements for a court order, making consent the only practical route—and consent gives us control over scope.

### Iowa Code § 125.37

Iowa Code § 125.37 separately protects SUD treatment records and tracks Part 2's framework. Use both Part 2 and § 125.37 in briefing.

### Practical Approach for SUD Providers

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Obtain narrow, Part 2-compliant written consent authorizing disclosure of treatment type and dates only, with all clinical content and provider identity excluded and no redisclosure permitted.

**Option 2 (If high identification risk):** Disclose de-identified date ranges (e.g., "Client attended SUD counseling sessions during Q1–Q3 2024") consistent with Part 2's minimum necessary standard.

---

## APPLICATION TO PROPOSED DISCLOSURE

### What We Propose to Disclose

**A letter from administrative personnel** (not the treating clinician) confirming:

- **Treatment type** (matched to opponent's specific allegation; e.g., "individual therapy" or "substance use disorder counseling").
- **Dates of attendance only** (no times, frequency, duration, or session length).

### What We Will NOT Disclose

- Provider names or identifying information.
- Diagnoses, symptoms, clinical observations, or assessments.
- Treatment goals, plans, progress, or outcomes.
- Any statement made by client to therapist.
- Any clinical opinion, recommendation, or characterization of "engagement," "improvement," or "compliance."
- Any session content whatsoever.

### Gate 1 Analysis: No Waiver Under Statutory Privilege

#### 1. Mental Health Is Opponent's Element, Not Ours

In Iowa custody cases, the party alleging unfitness bears the burden of proof. If opposing counsel claims our client has untreated mental health or substance abuse issues rendering her unfit, **mental health is their element to prove, not ours to defend.**

Under *Ashenfelter*, when opponent alleges unfitness and we deny it, we have not made mental condition an element or factor of our claim or defense. The Iowa Supreme Court held that "*denial of an element or factor of one's opponent's case does not make that element or factor part of the case of the person making the denial.*" 792 N.W.2d at 676.

*In re Marriage of Mulligan*, No. 11-0062, 2011 WL 2420005, at \*4 (Iowa Ct. App. June 15, 2011), applied this principle in custody context, holding that filing an answer in a dissolution case involving child custody does not put mental health at issue, even when custody is contested.

#### 2. Defensive Denial, Not Affirmative Placement

Confirming that treatment is occurring responds directly to opponent's specific allegation. This is quintessential **defensive denial**—rebutting opponent's claim without making mental health a basis of our own case.

We are not claiming:
- "Treatment proves fitness."
- "Successful therapy demonstrates parenting capacity."
- "Progress in counseling shows stability."

We are simply saying: **"Opponent alleges non-treatment; that allegation is factually incorrect; treatment of [type] is occurring."**

This defensive posture does not trigger Iowa Code § 622.10(2)'s patient-litigant exception.

#### 3. Administrative Facts vs. Confidential Communications

Iowa Code § 622.10(1) protects "**confidential communications**" between patient and mental health professional—statements, clinical content, therapeutic exchanges.

**We are disclosing no confidential communication.** We are disclosing only that appointments of a certain type occurred on certain dates. These are administrative facts, not privileged therapeutic content.

Iowa Code § 228.1 (mental health confidentiality chapter) separately defines "administrative information" (including dates of service) as distinct from protected clinical content. While § 228.1 appears outside the privilege statute, the statutory distinction provides supportive reasoning that Iowa law recognizes a difference between administrative facts and confidential therapeutic communications.

#### 4. Liberal Construction of Privilege; Narrow Construction of Waiver

Iowa courts "liberally construe evidentiary privileges to accomplish their protective purposes" and construe waivers narrowly. *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 675.

Any ambiguity about whether disclosure triggers waiver must be resolved **in favor of protecting the privilege.**

### Gate 2 Analysis: If Forced to Constitutional Privacy Balancing (Only If Gate 1 Fails)

If we lose Gate 1 argument (court finds statutory privilege waived under § 622.10(2)), we fall back to constitutional privacy. Applying the *McMaster* five-factor test as refined by *Fagen*:

#### Factor 1: Relevance

**Medium-to-high.** Treatment records have relevance to assessing current stability, which courts consider relevant to parenting capacity under Iowa Code § 598.41(3)(i) (mental health), (n) (other factors).

*This factor weighs against privacy in custody context.*

#### Factor 2: Availability of Alternative Means

**Strong argument for us.** Multiple alternatives exist:

- **Opponent can prove unfitness through other evidence** (their burden): third-party witnesses, school records, communications, parenting time observations, prior incidents.

- **Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.515 mental health examination** focused on current parenting capacity: Independent psychologist assesses current functioning only; no access to historical treatment files; no inquiry into session content with current providers; report addresses only current parenting capacity relevant to § 598.41(3) factors.

- **Iowa Code §§ 598.12–.12A custody evaluation** by agreement: Evaluator assesses parenting capacity through interview, testing, observation, collateral sources; privilege over treatment communications preserved unless client consents.

- **Stipulated facts** by agreement: attendance, compliance, negative drug tests (if applicable), no concerns requiring reporting.

*This factor weighs in favor of privacy.*

#### Factor 3: Demonstrated Need for Information

**This is where custody cases are vulnerable.** Opposing counsel will argue child welfare creates **compelling need.** *McMaster* holds that "compelling need for information may override the privacy interest." 509 N.W.2d at 759.

Courts may find child's best interests create sufficiently compelling need to override privacy—especially if opponent alleges active substance abuse, untreated serious mental illness, or specific incidents suggesting impaired parenting.

**Counter-argument:** Opponent must make a **concrete, specific showing** of need, not speculative or conclusory assertions. *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 834–35; *Howland*, 2023 WL 3613259, at \*3–5. Generalized assertions that "records might be relevant to custody" are insufficient. Opponent must show:

- Specific concerns based on evidence (not speculation).
- Why treatment records (as opposed to current functioning) are necessary.
- Why alternatives (Rule 1.515 exam, stipulations) are inadequate.

*This factor's outcome is uncertain and fact-specific.*

#### Factor 4: Patient's Privacy Interest

**High.** Mental health and substance abuse treatment records implicate the most sensitive, intimate personal information. Public policy of encouraging treatment-seeking requires strong privacy protection.

Federal courts recognize psychotherapist-patient privilege as absolute in federal proceedings specifically to encourage treatment. *Jaffee v. Redmond*, 518 U.S. 1, 10–18 (1996). *Jaffee*'s reasoning—that need-based balancing undermines the privilege and deters individuals from seeking treatment—provides persuasive policy support.

*This factor weighs strongly in favor of privacy.*

#### Factor 5: Public Interest

**Cuts both ways.**

**Favoring privacy:**
- Public interest in encouraging individuals to seek mental health and substance abuse treatment without fear of disclosure.
- Effective treatment requires candid communication; fear of later disclosure chills candor.
- *Jaffee* policy: privilege must be predictable to serve its purpose.

**Favoring disclosure:**
- Public interest in protecting children.
- Public interest in ensuring custody decisions serve child's best interests and are based on complete information.
- Iowa Code § 598.41(1) declares child's best interests paramount.

In custody cases, courts may find child protection interest outweighs treatment-seeking encouragement—particularly if allegations involve risk to child.

*This factor's outcome depends on how court weighs competing public interests.*

### Balancing Outcome: Uncertain

**Factors favoring privacy:** Availability of alternatives (Factor 2) and patient's privacy interest (Factor 4) weigh strongly in favor of protection.

**Factors weighing against privacy or uncertain:** Relevance (Factor 1) weighs against privacy. Need (Factor 3) and public interest (Factor 5) could realistically support disclosure in custody context where child welfare is paramount.

**This is why Gate 1 (statutory privilege) is critical—we cannot confidently rely on Gate 2 balancing test as fallback.**

## THE DISCLOSURE PACKAGE: WHAT YOU WILL PRODUCE (AND ONLY THIS)

To minimize door-opening risk and maximize protection on both Gate 1 and Gate 2, structure any disclosure with maximum safeguards.

### Component 1: Custodian Attendance Letter (Administrative Only)

**From:** Records custodian or administrative personnel (not the treating clinician).

**To:** [Your attorney].

**Re:** [Client name] – Attendance Confirmation for [Case Caption].

**Content:**

> This letter confirms the following administrative information regarding [client name]:
>
> **Treatment Type:** [Individual therapy / Substance use disorder counseling / Family therapy]
>
> **Dates of Attendance:** [List dates or state "ongoing since [start date], with sessions attended on [frequency, e.g., weekly basis]"]
>
> This letter discloses no diagnoses, symptoms, clinical observations, treatment goals, treatment progress, clinical opinions, or any communications between patient and provider. No further information will be disclosed absent patient's written consent or court order.

**Signature:** Records Custodian (not clinician).

**For SUD providers:** Accompany with Part 2-compliant written consent from client (see Part 2 section above) OR obtain Part 2 court order before disclosure.

### Component 2: Non-Waiver Legend (Attach to Disclosure and All Filings)

> **NON-WAIVER NOTICE**
>
> This limited disclosure is provided solely to rebut opposing party's allegation of non-treatment. No party places mental condition as an element of any claim or defense in this action.
>
> This disclosure does not waive and client expressly preserves all protections under:
>
> - Iowa Code § 622.10 (psychotherapist-patient privilege);
> - Constitutional right to privacy under the Iowa Constitution;
> - Iowa Code Chapter 228 (mental health information confidentiality);
> - Iowa Code § 125.37 (substance abuse treatment confidentiality); and
> - 42 C.F.R. Part 2 (federal substance abuse confidentiality regulations).
>
> No confidential communications have been disclosed. No further disclosure of mental health or substance abuse treatment information will be made absent specific court order following *McMaster*/*Fagen* analysis, threshold showing under *Howland*, in-camera review, and narrow tailoring.

### Component 3: Contemporaneous Motion for Protective Order

File **simultaneously with or immediately after** disclosure.

**Requested relief:**

1. **Scope cap:** The attendance confirmation constitutes the full extent of treatment-related disclosure absent further court order. No depositions, subpoenas, or other discovery directed to treatment providers or records.

2. **Use limits:**
   - Use in this case only.
   - Sealed filing; no public access.
   - Attorney's-eyes-only (or add counsel-and-party if appropriate).
   - No redisclosure to third parties.
   - For SUD treatment: Explicit 42 C.F.R. Part 2 compliance; no redisclosure absent Part 2-compliant consent or order.

3. **Bar on follow-on discovery:** No further discovery into treatment records, communications, diagnoses, progress, or clinical content unless moving party first:
   - Satisfies *McMaster* five-factor balancing test and *Fagen* specific-nexus requirement;
   - Makes threshold showing under *Howland* sufficient to justify even in-camera review;
   - Demonstrates alternatives are inadequate; and
   - Court conducts in-camera review and narrowly tailors any disclosure with redactions and time limits.

4. **Alternative offered:** If Court determines additional information is necessary, client will submit to narrow Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.515 mental health examination limited to current parenting capacity, with no examiner access to historical treatment files and no inquiry into session content.

**Grounds (summary):**

- **Iowa Code § 622.10:** No waiver; disclosure is defensive denial under *Ashenfelter*; no confidential communications disclosed.
- **Constitutional privacy:** *McMaster*/*Fagen* balancing; alternatives exist; patient's high privacy interest; narrow tailoring required.
- **Part 2 (if SUD):** Federal regulations prohibit broader disclosure; client's consent (if applicable) limited to dates/type only.
- **Public policy:** *Jaffee* reasoning; encouraging treatment-seeking requires robust privacy protection.

---

## IF OPPOSING COUNSEL MOVES TO COMPEL: OPPOSITION STRATEGY

### Primary Argument (Gate 1): No Waiver Under Iowa Code § 622.10

**Standard:** Iowa Code § 622.10(2) patient-litigant exception applies only when patient "introduces the patient's mental . . . condition as an element of the patient's claim or defense."

**Application:**

1. **Mental health is opponent's element, not ours.** Opponent alleges unfitness due to untreated mental health or substance abuse; opponent bears burden of proof. We have not made mental health an element or factor of our custody claim.

2. **Defensive denial does not waive privilege.** "*Denial of an element or factor of one's opponent's case does not make that element or factor part of the case of the person making the denial.*" *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 676. *In re Marriage of Mulligan*, 2011 WL 2420005, at \*4 (applying *Ashenfelter* to hold filing answer in custody case does not put mental health at issue).

3. **No confidential communications disclosed.** Attendance letter disclosed administrative facts (dates, type) only. No statements, clinical content, diagnoses, symptoms, or opinions disclosed. Iowa Code § 228.1 distinguishes administrative information from protected clinical content.

4. **Liberal construction of privilege; narrow construction of waiver.** *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 675. Any ambiguity resolved in favor of privilege.

**Conclusion (Gate 1):** Iowa Code § 622.10 privilege remains intact. No waiver occurred. Records are protected. Motion to compel should be denied.

### Failsafe Argument (Gate 2—Only If Court Reaches Constitutional Privacy)

If court finds § 622.10(2) exception applies (we disagree), client's qualified constitutional privacy right provides second layer of protection. *Ashenfelter*, 792 N.W.2d at 672–73; *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 831.

**Threshold Requirement:** Opposing counsel must make **concrete, specific showing** of relevance and need before court even conducts in-camera review. *State v. Howland*, 2023 WL 3613259, at \*3–5 (reversing in-camera review where moving party failed to make threshold showing; even in-camera review invades privacy and requires justification).

**McMaster Five-Factor Balancing:**

1. **Relevance (Factor 1):** Opponent must show specific nexus between particular records sought and live custody issue. Conclusory assertions insufficient. *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 834–35.

2. **Alternatives (Factor 2):** Multiple less intrusive means exist: Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.515 current-functioning examination (no access to historical files); custody evaluation by agreement (§§ 598.12–.12A); stipulated facts; opponent's own evidence of unfitness (their burden). Alternatives must be exhausted or considered. *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 835.

3. **Demonstrated need (Factor 3):** Opponent bears burden to show concrete need, not speculative or fishing-expedition assertions. Child welfare interest does not automatically override privacy; opponent must show why treatment records (as opposed to current functioning) are necessary and why alternatives inadequate.

4. **Privacy interest (Factor 4):** Highest level of privacy; encourages treatment-seeking; *Jaffee* policy. 518 U.S. at 10–18.

5. **Public interest (Factor 5):** Public interest in encouraging treatment weighs against disclosure; balancing required.

**Narrow Tailoring Required:** If court orders any disclosure after balancing, production must be: (1) limited in scope and time; (2) redacted of unnecessary clinical content; (3) subject to protective order. *Fagen*, 861 N.W.2d at 835.

**Part 2 (if SUD):** 42 C.F.R. Part 2 prohibits disclosure absent compliant court order meeting Subpart E requirements (good cause, minimum necessary, no redisclosure, sealed). Federal law preempts state court's authority to order broader disclosure.

**Conclusion (Gate 2):** If court reaches constitutional privacy analysis, *McMaster*/*Fagen* balancing and *Howland* threshold showing favor protection. At minimum, limit disclosure through in-camera review, narrow tailoring, and protective order.

### Offer a Narrower "More-Info" Off-Ramp

**Alternative to records production:** If Court determines additional information beyond attendance confirmation is necessary to resolve custody issues, client offers to submit to:

**Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.515 mental health examination** limited to current parenting capacity:

- Independent psychologist appointed by agreement or court order.
- Examination focused exclusively on current functional ability and parenting capacity relevant to Iowa Code § 598.41(3) factors.
- Examiner expressly prohibited from reviewing historical treatment records or clinical notes.
- No inquiry into content of therapeutic sessions with current or past providers.
- Examination limited to: clinical interview, standardized parenting assessment instruments, observation of parent-child interaction (if appropriate), collateral interviews (if appropriate).
- Report addresses only current functioning relevant to parenting; no historical treatment content.
- Client retains all privileges regarding communications with current providers.

**OR**

**Iowa Code §§ 598.12–.12A custody evaluation** by agreement, with same limits on access to historical treatment records and session content.

**Advantage:** Provides court with independent, current assessment of parenting capacity while maintaining privilege over existing treatment records and communications. Addresses court's information needs without triggering waiver or constitutional privacy balancing on historical records.

---

## GUARDRAILS: WHAT NOT TO DO

To preserve Gate 1 and Gate 2 protections, **strictly avoid:**

1. **Do not claim therapy "proves fitness," "improvement," or "stability."** Any affirmative reliance on mental health treatment as evidence of fitness risks transforming defensive denial into affirmative placement, triggering § 622.10(2) patient-litigant exception.

2. **Do not call the treating provider as a witness.** Treating provider testimony about progress, engagement, or clinical impressions would disclose privileged communications and waive privilege.

3. **Do not disclose diagnoses, symptoms, progress notes, goals, recommendations, or any session content.** Limit to dates/type only.

4. **Do not argue that "best interests of the child" overrides Iowa Code § 622.10 statutory privilege.** Statutory privilege is not subject to best-interests balancing; if balancing occurs, it belongs in Gate 2 (constitutional privacy), not Gate 1. Conflating the two gates weakens Gate 1 argument.

5. **Do not voluntarily offer treatment records for in-camera review.** Opponent must satisfy *Howland* threshold showing before in-camera review justified.

6. **Do not characterize treatment content or progress.** Statements like "client has been compliant," "therapy is going well," or "provider reports progress" disclose clinical opinions and risk waiver.

---

## ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES IF COURT INDICATES CONCERN

If court signals concerns about attendance confirmation or skepticism about Gate 1 statutory privilege argument, consider these alternatives **before** allowing discovery into records:

### Option 1: Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.515 Mental Health Examination (Preferred Alternative)

**Proposal:** Client submits to narrow examination focused exclusively on current parenting capacity.

**Structure:**

- Independent psychologist appointed by agreement or court order.
- Examination assesses current parenting capacity and functional ability only.
- Examiner expressly prohibited from reviewing historical treatment records or clinical notes.
- No inquiry into content of therapeutic sessions with current or past providers.
- Examination limited to: clinical interview, standardized parenting assessment instruments, observation of parent-child interaction.
- Report addresses only current functioning relevant to Iowa Code § 598.41(3) factors.
- Client retains all privileges regarding communications with current providers.

**Advantage:** Provides court with independent expert assessment of current parenting capacity while maintaining privilege over existing records. Addresses court's information needs without waiving either statutory privilege or triggering constitutional privacy balancing test on historical treatment records.

### Option 2: Stipulated Facts by Agreement

**Proposal:** Negotiate with opposing counsel stipulated facts both parties can accept.

**Example stipulations:**

- Client has attended [treatment type] since [date].
- Attendance has been consistent.
- Client has complied with treatment provider recommendations.
- Drug/alcohol testing results have been negative for [time period] (if applicable).
- Treatment providers have not expressed concerns requiring mandatory reporting under Iowa Code § 232.69 (child abuse) (if applicable and accurate).

**Advantage:** Addresses court's information needs without privilege waiver or constitutional privacy balancing; no discovery into records; no clinical content disclosed.

### Option 3: Proceed Without Treatment Evidence

**Strategy:** Rest entirely on non-privileged evidence of parenting capacity under Iowa Code § 598.41(3):

- Historical caregiving patterns (*In re Marriage of Hansen*, 733 N.W.2d 683, 696 (Iowa 2007)) (approximation rule).
- Current parenting routine and child's wellbeing.
- School continuity and stability.
- Housing and employment stability.
- Communication and cooperation with co-parent (§ 598.41(3)(e)).
- Third-party observations (teachers, doctors, family, friends).
- General stability indicators.

**Strategic point:** Force opponent to prove their unfitness allegations (their burden) without providing treatment information that might create waiver issues.

**Advantage:** Absolute privilege protection on both Gate 1 and Gate 2; no waiver risk whatsoever; avoids constitutional privacy balancing entirely.

## CONCLUSION

**Gate 1 (Statutory Privilege—Primary Argument):** Offering carefully limited confirmation of treatment type and attendance dates, paired with express non-waiver reservation and protective order, should not open the door for opposing counsel to compel production of mental health and substance abuse records under Iowa Code § 622.10. Under *Ashenfelter*, this is defensive denial, not affirmative placement. We disclose no confidential communications—only administrative facts. Statutory privilege remains intact.

**Gate 2 (Constitutional Privacy—Fallback if Gate 1 Fails):** Even if statutory privilege were found not to apply, Iowa's qualified constitutional privacy right provides a second layer of protection. However, *Fagen* makes clear this protection is not absolute and requires *McMaster* five-factor balancing. In custody cases, child welfare may create compelling need sufficient to override privacy interests, making this an uncertain fallback.

**SUD Overlay:** For substance use disorder treatment, 42 C.F.R. Part 2 prohibits disclosure of any patient-identifying information (including attendance) absent a compliant consent or court order meeting stringent Subpart E requirements. Part 2 provides additional federal protection layer.

**Risk Assessment:** This is a **controlled-risk strategy** presenting **medium risk** because:

1. No Iowa appellate decision squarely addresses dates/type-only attendance disclosure in custody cases.
2. We are arguing by analogy from *Ashenfelter* (grandparent visitation) to custody context.
3. Some judges may have fairness concerns about partial disclosure or may find custody's child-welfare imperative distinguishable.
4. If forced to Gate 2 constitutional privacy balancing, child welfare interests could realistically overcome privacy protection under *McMaster*/*Fagen* test.

**Critical Strategic Point:** **We must win at Gate 1 (statutory privilege).** We cannot confidently rely on Gate 2 (constitutional privacy) as fallback because the required balancing test could realistically go against us in custody litigation where child welfare is paramount. This makes execution with maximum protective procedures (non-waiver legend, protective order, strict content limits) absolutely essential.

**If Opposing Counsel Moves to Compel:** We have strong arguments based on Iowa statutory framework and *Ashenfelter* controlling precedent, but be prepared to litigate vigorously on an issue of first impression. If Gate 1 fails, Gate 2 constitutional privacy balancing becomes uncertain in custody context. Offer Rule 1.515 current-functioning examination as less intrusive alternative.

## APPENDIX: 60-SECOND HEARING SCRIPT

**"Your Honor, under Iowa Code § 622.10 we disclosed no communications—only dates and modality to rebut a non-treatment allegation. *Ashenfelter* and *Hutchinson* make clear there is no waiver by denial; mental health remains their element, not ours.**

**If the Court looks further, *McMaster* and *Fagen* require a specific nexus, proof that alternatives are inadequate, and then in-camera review only after a threshold showing under *Howland*. Opposing counsel has not made that showing.**

**For any substance use disorder provider, 42 C.F.R. Part 2 prohibits disclosure of patient-identifying information absent a compliant consent or court order under Subpart E. We provided a narrow consent limited to dates and type only; Part 2 bars broader disclosure.**

**We ask the Court to enter our protective order and deny broader production. If the Court determines additional information is necessary, we will submit to a narrow Rule 1.515 current-functioning evaluation without the examiner accessing historical treatment files or inquiring into session content. That addresses the Court's information needs while protecting the privilege and constitutional privacy.**

**Thank you, Your Honor."**
