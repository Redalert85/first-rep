# MBE Master Guide

Comprehensive multi-subject outline using the cognitive learning framework established for Real Property and expanded across the remaining core MBE subjects.

## Universal Cognitive Framework – "The Law School Campus"
Picture a law school campus where each building encodes a doctrinal universe. Walking this campus during review reinforces spatial, story-based, and analytical memory encoding.

| Subject | Memory Palace Anchor | Core Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constitutional Law | Supreme Court Building | Government structure & individual rights safeguards |
| Torts | Medical Center & Courthouse | Injuries, liability, and remedies |
| Contracts | Business School | Promises, bargain formation, breach |
| Criminal Law | Police Precinct | Defining offenses and defenses |
| Criminal Procedure | Detective Agency | Investigations and constitutional safeguards |
| Civil Procedure | Litigation Center | Jurisdiction, pleadings, adjudication |
| Evidence | Library & Courtroom | Admissibility and proof at trial |
| Real Property | Land Registry (from prior guide) | Estates, conveyancing, land use |

**Note**: Real Property is comprehensively covered in dedicated guides (`real_property_mbe_master_guide.md`, `real_property_study_guide.md`, etc.) and integrated into the memory palace system. This master guide focuses on the remaining 7 core MBE subjects.

Each subject section follows the same scaffold:

1. **Core Rule (≤ 25 words)** – captures the doctrinal essence.
2. **Story Method** – a vivid metaphor anchoring major themes.
3. **Major Topic Architecture** – blueprint for subtopics.
4. **Critical Sub-Rules with Learning Aids** – checklists, mnemonics, diagrams.
5. **Most-Tested Traps** – common MBE pitfalls.
6. **Micro-Hypos** – targeted practice to inoculate against traps.
7. **Visuals / Flowcharts** – ASCII diagrams linking rules to analysis steps.

## Constitutional Law – Supreme Court Building

### Core Rule (25 words)
Constitutional law allocates power between federal branches, restrains state action via incorporation, protects fundamental rights, and authorizes judicial review (Marbury v. Madison).

### Story Method – "The Three Branches Machine"
Visualize the Constitution as the operating manual for a machine with three parts that must collaborate yet restrain each other. Congress writes rules, the President executes, and the Supreme Court referees disputes.

### Major Topic Architecture
1. Judicial Power & Justiciability
2. Federal Legislative Power
3. Executive Power
4. Federalism & State Power
5. Individual Rights – Due Process
6. Equal Protection
7. First Amendment – Speech
8. First Amendment – Religion

#### 1. Judicial Power & Justiciability
- **Rule**: Case-or-controversy requirement demands standing (injury, causation, redressability), ripeness, and absence of mootness or political questions.
- **Mnemonic**: `SCRAM` – Standing, Case/Controversy, Ripeness, Advisory opinions barred, Mootness.
- **Visual**: Standing triangle connecting injury, causation, redressability.
- **Traps**: Taxpayer standing (usually none), generalized grievances, mootness exceptions (e.g., pregnancy), political-question doctrine.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Polluted river (standing), generalized constitutional grievance (no standing), pre-enforcement challenge without hardship (not ripe), abortion case after birth (exception).

#### 2. Federal Legislative Power – "Commerce Clause Circus"
- **Rule**: Congress operates within enumerated powers; Commerce Clause covers channels, instrumentalities, and substantial economic effects; Necessary & Proper clause implements enumerated powers.
- **Mnemonic**: `Can People Truly Win Now?` – Channels, Persons/things, Totally affects commerce, Within limits, Necessary & Proper.
- **Traps**: Intrastate non-economic activity (Lopez), attenuated chains under substantial-effects theory, anti-commandeering (New York v. US), coercive spending conditions.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Gun-free school zones (invalid), wheat for home consumption (valid), highway funds threatened entirely (coercive), national bank for tax collection (valid under N&P).

#### 3. Executive Power – "Youngstown Spectrum"
- **Rule**: Presidential power peaks with congressional authorization, declines in twilight zones, bottomed out when defying Congress.
- **Mnemonic**: `VETO PACT` – Veto, Executive agreements, Treaties (with Senate), Officers (appoint/remove), Pardons, Army command, Criminal immunity (official acts), Territorial recognition.
- **Traps**: Executive agreements = binding without Senate, removal limits for independent agencies, pardon excludes impeachment, line-item veto unconstitutional.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Criminal subpoena of executive tapes (privilege overridden), firing independent agency head (invalid without cause), executive agreement vs treaty (valid), pardon for impeachment (invalid).

#### 4. Federalism & State Power
- **Rule**: Tenth Amendment reserves unenumerated powers; Supremacy Clause preempts conflicts; dormant Commerce Clause prevents discriminatory burdens; states cannot tax the federal government.
- **Mnemonic**: `DORM ROOM` – Discriminatory laws (strict scrutiny), Out-of-state burden (Pike), Reasonable relationship, Market participant exception.
- **Traps**: Facial neutrality with discriminatory effect, Article IV Privileges & Immunities limited to citizens, federal commandeering of states, market-participant exception boundaries.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Waste-processing requirement (invalid), state purchasing preferences (valid market participant), out-of-state recreation fee (invalid without justification), federal safety standards + state add-ons (preemption analysis).

#### 5. Individual Rights – Due Process
- **Rule**: Procedural DP requires notice + hearing for life/liberty/property; substantive DP protects fundamental rights via strict scrutiny, otherwise rational basis.
- **Mnemonic**: `MR. FIG CAP` – Marriage, Raising children, Family living together, Intimate conduct, Generating offspring, Contraception, Abortion (undue burden), Parental rights.
- **Traps**: At-will employment lacks property interest, stigma-plus requirement, emergency exceptions for hearings, undue burden standard for abortion (not strict scrutiny).
- **Micro-Hypos**: License revocation without hearing (violation), at-will employee termination (no violation), cohabitation ban (invalid), price controls (valid).

#### 6. Equal Protection – "Three-Tier Circus"
- **Rule**: Classification triggers scrutiny: suspect (strict), quasi-suspect (intermediate), others (rational basis); fundamental rights also trigger strict scrutiny.
- **Mnemonic**: `RAN GIL` – Race, Alienage, National origin (strict); Gender, Illegitimacy (intermediate); Legitimate interest (rational basis for others).
- **Traps**: Need discriminatory intent, federal alienage uses rational basis, affirmative action strict scrutiny, wealth/age non-suspect.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Race-conscious admissions (strict), gender-based drafts (intermediate), disparate impact alone (rational basis), non-citizen voting limit (rational basis).

#### 7. First Amendment – Speech
- **Rule**: Content-based regulations = strict scrutiny; content-neutral TPM = intermediate; unprotected categories include incitement, obscenity, fighting words, true threats, child pornography.
- **Mnemonic**: `FOCI` (Fighting words, Obscenity, Child pornography, Incitement); `SLAPS` for Miller test.
- **Traps**: Incitement requires imminence, fighting words must be face-to-face, prior restraint presumption, viewpoint discrimination fatal.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Political sign ban (invalid), abstract overthrow advocacy (protected), leafleting ban (invalid), attorney advertising ban (fails Central Hudson).

#### 8. First Amendment – Religion
- **Rule**: Establishment Clause prohibits endorsement/coercion; Free Exercise absolutely protects belief, protects conduct when laws target religion.
- **Mnemonic**: `LEG SPAN` (Lemon test components);
- **Traps**: Smith (neutral laws need no exemptions), school prayer always problematic, aid to religious schools permissible if neutral, context matters for displays.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Moment of silence (likely valid), neutral textbook aid (valid), peyote law (valid neutral law), solitary nativity display (invalid endorsement).

## Torts – Hospital & Courthouse

### Core Rule (23 words)
Tort law imposes civil liability for breaches of duty causing harm, providing compensation and deterrence via intentional torts, negligence, strict liability, and defamation/privacy.

### Story Method – "Emergency Ward Liability"
Visualize a hospital emergency ward attached to a courthouse. Doctors triage injuries (duty, breach, causation, damages) while judges assign liability and defenses.

### Major Topic Architecture
1. Intentional Torts
2. Negligence
3. Strict Liability & Products
4. Defamation & Privacy
5. Economic & Dignitary Torts
6. Vicarious Liability & Damages

#### 1. Intentional Torts
- **Rule**: Battery, assault, false imprisonment, IIED require volitional acts with intent or substantial certainty.
- **Mnemonic**: `BAFI²` – Battery, Assault, False imprisonment, Intentional infliction.
- **Traps**: Transferred intent, consent scope, shopkeeper’s privilege limits, extreme/outrageous threshold for IIED.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Swing misses near body (assault), prank causing panic pregnancy (IIED), blocking exit with reasonable escape (no false imprisonment), hitting wrong person (transferred intent).

#### 2. Negligence

- **Micro-Hypos**: Blasting rock (strict), pet tiger injures (strict), product defect w/o adequate warning (liable), unforeseeable misuse (no liability).

#### 4. Defamation & Privacy
- **Rule**: False statements harming reputation; public concern triggers constitutional actual-fault requirements.
- **Mnemonic**: `PDPF` – Publication, Defamatory statement, Plaintiff identification, Fault.
- **Traps**: Opinions vs fact, public vs private figures (actual malice vs negligence), privacy tort distinctions (intrusion, false light, appropriation, disclosure).

## Contracts – Business School Atrium

### Core Rule (24 words)
Contracts enforce bargained-for agreements formed with offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent, subject to defenses, conditions, and remedies for breach.

### Story Method – "Deal Summit"
Imagine a business school atrium where parties negotiate at tables, drafting terms, checking consideration, and managing breach fallout.

### Major Topic Architecture
1. Formation (Offer, Acceptance, Consideration)
2. Contract Terms & Interpretation (UCC vs Common Law)
3. Performance, Breach, and Conditions
4. Remedies & Damages
5. Defenses to Enforcement
6. Third-Party Rights

#### 1. Formation
- **Mnemonic**: `FOCI` – Offer, Consideration, Intent, Acceptance.
- **Traps**: Advertisements (invitations), UCC firm offers, mailbox rule twists, option contracts, pre-existing duty rule.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Revocation before acceptance (effective upon receipt), mailbox rule vs option contract (receipt), illusory promise (no consideration).

#### 2. Terms & Interpretation
- **Rule**: Common law mirror-image; UCC gap fillers; parol evidence.
- **Traps**: Battle of forms, parol evidence exceptions (ambiguity, fraud), course of performance hierarchy.

#### 3. Performance & Breach
- **Rule**: Common law substantial performance vs material breach; UCC perfect tender.
- **Traps**: Anticipatory repudiation (reasonable assurances), divisible contracts, condition precedent vs subsequent.

#### 4. Remedies
- **Mnemonic**: `ERRS` – Expectation, Reliance, Restitution, Specific performance.
- **Traps**: Foreseeability (Hadley), mitigation duties, liquidated damages (reasonable estimate, not penalty).

#### 5. Defenses
- **Mnemonic**: `STUPID` – Statute of Frauds, Unconscionability, Duress, Illegality, Mistake (mutual/unilateral), Impossibility/Impracticability/Frustration.
- **Traps**: SOF partial performance exceptions, mutual mistake vs unilateral, impossibility vs frustration.

#### 6. Third-Party Rights
- **Rule**: Assignments, delegations, third-party beneficiaries.
- **Traps**: Revocation of gratuitous assignments, delegation of special skills, vesting of third-party rights.

#### 7. UCC Delivery, Title & Risk of Loss
- **Hierarchy**: (1) Agreement controls (shipment/destination terms), (2) Breaching party bears risk until cure or acceptance, (3) Default rules.
- **Shipment vs Destination**: FOB seller’s city (RoL shifts upon delivery to carrier if seller meets shipment duties); FOB buyer’s city (RoL upon tender at destination).
- **No Carrier**: Merchant sellers transfer risk on buyer’s **receipt**; non-merchant sellers upon **tender of delivery**.
- **Casualty to Identified Goods**: Destroyed without fault before risk passes → contract avoided; partial destruction → buyer may rescind or accept with price reduction.
- **Entrustment & Voidable Title**: Entrusting to merchant allows transfer of good title to buyer in ordinary course; voidable title can pass good title to good-faith purchaser.
- **Traps**: Breach always keeps risk on breaching party; “FOB plant” is shipment, not destination; merchant receipt requirement.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Goods destroyed after carrier receives them under FOB seller term (buyer bears risk); nonconforming tender rejected (seller bears risk); identified goods destroyed pre-transfer (contract avoided).

#### 8. Acceptance, Rejection & Revocation (UCC)
- **Acceptance**: Occurs by accepting goods, failing to reject in reasonable time, or acting inconsistently with seller’s ownership.
- **Rejection**: Must be timely with notice; buyer holds goods with reasonable care. Single delivery → any nonconformity; installment contracts → substantial impairment standard.
- **Revocation of Acceptance**: Allowed if nonconformity substantially impairs value and defect hard to discover or reliance on cure; must revoke within reasonable time before substantial change.
- **Adequate Assurances**: Reasonable grounds for insecurity allow written demand; failure to provide within 30 days = anticipatory repudiation.
- **Traps**: Using goods extensively after discovering defect can bar revocation; COD shipments limit inspection rights.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Latent defect discovered later (revocation allowed); installment defect cured (rejection improper); demand for assurance ignored (repudiation).

#### 9. Excuse: Impossibility, Impracticability, Frustration
- **Impossibility / Impracticability**: Supervening event, basic assumption, no fault, risk not assumed; UCC allows relief for extreme unforeseen shortages or destroyed identified goods.
- **Partial Impracticability**: Seller must allocate production fairly and notify buyers.
- **Frustration of Purpose**: Principal purpose substantially frustrated; event basic assumption; no fault; no risk allocation.
- **Traps**: Mere increased cost insufficient unless extreme; assuming price fluctuation risk defeats excuse.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Government ban rendering performance illegal (impossibility); unforeseen embargo causing massive shortage (impracticability); parade cancelled destroying renter’s purpose (frustration).

#### 10. Modification, Accord & Satisfaction, Novation
- **Modification**: Common law needs new consideration (unless unforeseen circumstances); UCC only good faith, no consideration; check “no oral modification” clauses.
- **Accord & Satisfaction**: Accord substitutes new performance; satisfaction discharges original duty. Breach permits action on original or accord.
- **Novation**: All parties agree to substitute new obligor/ obligee; original party discharged.
- **Traps**: Modification of firm offer beyond three months requires fresh consideration; distinguishing novation from assignment/delegation.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Parties agree to accept lesser sum with new consideration (binding); new obligor agreed by all parties (novation); substituted performance breached (sue on original).

#### 11. Warranties (UCC & Common)
- **Express**: Affirmations, descriptions, samples that form part of basis of bargain.
- **Implied Warranty of Merchantability**: Merchant sellers; goods fit for ordinary purpose.
- **Implied Warranty of Fitness**: Seller knows buyer’s purpose and reliance; applies even to non-merchant if reliance reasonable.
- **Disclaimers**: Express warranties hard to disclaim; merchantability disclaimer must mention “merchantability” and be conspicuous; fitness disclaimer must be conspicuous writing; “as is/with all faults” effective.
- **Limitations**: Remedy limitations must not fail of essential purpose; personal injury limitations on consumer goods often unconscionable.
- **Privity & Tort Overlap**: Modern trend extends protection to foreseeable users; strict products liability provides parallel recovery.
- **Traps**: Statements of opinion/puffery not express warranties; “as is” doesn’t negate express warranties; limitations failing essential purpose open door to full UCC remedies.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Merchant says “good for 10 years” (express warranty); car sold “as is” but seller provided sample (express warranty governs); remedy limited to repair but repeated failures (limit fails essential purpose).
- **Visuals**: Risk of Loss Decision Tree (`visuals/contracts/ucc_risk_of_loss_tree.png`); Warranties Overview Map (`visuals/contracts/warranties_overview_map.png`).

## Criminal Law – Police Precinct

### Core Rule (24 words)
Criminal law requires a voluntary act (actus reus), culpable mental state (mens rea), concurrence, and causation; defenses negate elements or justify/excuse; party liability extends through accomplices and conspirators.

### Story Method – "The Police Station"
Picture a police station with four departments: Intake (what crime occurred?), Investigation (who did it?), Prosecutor (can we prove mens rea?), and Defense (what defenses apply?). Every case travels through the same workflow, reinforcing systematic analysis.

### Major Topic Architecture
1. Elements of Crimes – Actus Reus & Mens Rea
2. Homicide Offenses
3. Other Crimes Against Persons
4. Property Crimes
5. Inchoate Crimes
6. Accomplice & Accessory Liability
7. Defenses – Justification & Excuse
8. Integration & Flowcharts

#### 1. Elements of Crimes – Actus Reus & Mens Rea
- **Rule**: Every offense needs a voluntary act (or qualifying omission), the requisite mental state, concurrence, and causation.
- **Actus Reus**: Voluntary bodily movement; liability for omission only with legal duty (statute, status relationship, contract, voluntary rescue, created peril). Possession counts if aware and long enough to divest.
- **Mens Rea (MPC hierarchy)**: Purpose → Knowledge → Recklessness → Negligence (`PARK`). Common-law categories: specific intent, general intent, malice, strict liability.
- **Concurrence**: Intent must exist when act occurs; later-formed intent insufficient.
- **Causation**: Actual (but-for/substantial factor) + proximate (foreseeable). Dependent intervening causes keep liability; independent unforeseeable breaks chain.
- **Mnemonics**: `PARK` for MPC; `Some People Kill For Money` for common specific-intent crimes.
- **Visual**: Mens rea ladder (Purpose → Knowledge → Recklessness → Negligence → Strict liability).
- **Traps**: Specific vs general intent (intoxication defenses), transferred intent limited to same crime, medical negligence generally foreseeable, strict liability defeats mistake defenses.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Parent omission (duty); Russian roulette (recklessness); malpractice after stabbing (proximate cause); transferred intent for unintended victim.

#### 2. Homicide Offenses
- **Rule**: Murder = unlawful killing with malice aforethought (intent to kill, intent to seriously injure, depraved heart, felony murder). Manslaughter lacks malice.
- **Hierarchy**: First-degree (premeditated/deliberate; certain statutory methods), Second-degree (all other malice murders), Voluntary manslaughter (adequate provocation + no cooling), Involuntary manslaughter (criminal negligence or misdemeanor-manslaughter).
- **Felony Murder**: Inherently dangerous felony (BARRK) during commission; excludes assaultive felonies (merger); applies during res gestae; agency vs proximate cause theories.
- **Mnemonics**: `PIFK` for malice states; `BARRK` for predicate felonies.
- **Traps**: Instant premeditation allowed; deadly weapon inference; felony-murder merger; cooling-off defeats voluntary manslaughter; police/victim killings not felony murder (agency theory).
- **Micro-Hypos**: Planned killing (first-degree); depraved heart shooting; felony murder with assault (merger); heat-of-passion adultery killing; police shoot co-felon (no felony murder under agency theory).

#### 3. Other Crimes Against Persons
- **Battery**: Unlawful application of force causing injury/offense; general intent. Aggravated with serious injury, deadly weapon, or protected victim.
- **Assault**: Attempted battery (specific intent) or placing another in reasonable apprehension of imminent harm.
- **Kidnapping**: Unlawful confinement plus asportation/secreting; aggravated for ransom, harm, or minors.
- **False Imprisonment**: Unlawful confinement with awareness/harm; no movement needed.
- **Rape**: Nonconsensual sexual penetration; modern consent focuses on affirmative consent and covers all genders; statutory rape is strict liability.
- **Mnemonic**: `BARK` (Battery–Assault distinctions; Reasonable apprehension; Knowing contact).
- **Traps**: Battery requires only intent to touch; assault has two theories; kidnapping needs substantial movement; mistake of age no defense to statutory rape.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Playful shove causing injury (battery); apparent threat with unloaded gun (assault); brief forced transport increasing risk (kidnapping); strict-liability statutory rape.

#### 4. Property Crimes
- **Larceny**: Trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property with intent to permanently deprive; continuing trespass doctrine.
- **Robbery**: Larceny plus force/intimidation from person/presence.
- **Embezzlement**: Fraudulent conversion by one initially in lawful possession.
- **False Pretenses**: Obtaining title by material misrepresentation; contrasts with larceny by trick (possession only).
- **Burglary**: Breaking and entering of dwelling at night (CL) or structure (modern) with intent to commit felony at entry.
- **Mnemonic**: `LREF` (Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False pretenses based on possession/title); `BEN AT NIGHT` for burglary elements.
- **Traps**: Intent at time of taking (larceny); assaultive felonies merge; force must accompany taking for robbery; burglary intent must pre-exist entry.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Continuing trespass; purse snatch with struggle; teller conversion; misrepresentation of present fact to obtain title; burglary with breaking of unlocked door.

#### 5. Inchoate Crimes
- **Solicitation**: Request/command another to commit crime with intent; crime complete upon ask; merges into conspiracy if agreement.
- **Conspiracy**: Agreement + intent + overt act (majority). Pinkerton liability for foreseeable crimes. No merger with completed offense. MPC allows unilateral conspiracy.
- **Attempt**: Specific intent to commit target crime + substantial step (MPC) / dangerous proximity (CL); factual impossibility no defense; legal impossibility is.
- **Mnemonics**: `SAC` (Solicitation, Attempt, Conspiracy requirements); `PAWS` (Plurality, Agreement, With intent, Some overt act).
- **Traps**: Solicitation complete without acceptance; conspiracy survives completed offense; attempt always specific intent; abandonment defense limited (MPC).
- **Micro-Hypos**: Solicitor rebuffed; conspiracy plus completed robbery; factual impossibility (empty pocket) still attempt; legal impossibility (not actually contraband) is defense; withdrawal limits Pinkerton liability only.

#### 6. Accomplice & Accessory Liability
- **Accomplice**: Aid/encourage with intent to assist AND intent that crime occurs; liable for target crime + foreseeable collateral crimes. Must withdraw by repudiation, neutralizing aid, or notifying authorities before point of no return.
- **Accessory After the Fact**: Assists after felony with knowledge and intent to avoid arrest; separate offense (obstruction).
- **Principal**: Direct perpetrator; modern statutes treat aiders as principals.
- **Mnemonics**: `AAA` (Aid/abet + intent to Assist + intent to Achieve crime).
- **Traps**: Mere presence insufficient; dual intent requirement; accomplice liability remains even if principal acquitted; accessory after fact not liable for underlying offense.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Gun supplier with criminal intent; unpredicted homicide during burglary; hiding fugitive; effective withdrawal.

#### 7. Defenses – Justification & Excuse
- **Self-Defense**: Reasonable belief in imminent unlawful force; proportional response. Deadly force requires threat of death/serious injury. Majority no duty to retreat; minority requires if safe (except home). Initial aggressor must withdraw or victim escalate to claim. Imperfect self-defense reduces to voluntary manslaughter.
- **Defense of Others/Property/Necessity**: Protect others with reasonable appearance; property only non-deadly; necessity requires lesser harm, no lawful alternative, not at fault.
- **Duress**: Imminent threat of death/serious harm; no reasonable escape; not defense to intentional homicide (majority).
- **Intoxication**: Voluntary intoxication only for specific-intent crimes; involuntary is defense to all if it negates mens rea.
- **Insanity Tests**: `INSANE` mnemonic (Irresistible impulse, Nature/quality, Substantial capacity, Appreciate wrongfulness, Not conform conduct, Excuses). Know M'Naghten (cognitive), Irresistible impulse (volitional), MPC (substantial capacity), Durham (product).
- **Infancy**: <7 absolute defense; 7-14 rebuttable presumption; 14+ adult treatment unless juvenile system.
- **Entrapment**: Majority subjective (government inducement + lack of predisposition); MPC objective (government conduct). Mere opportunity ≠ entrapment.
- **Mistake**: Fact – honest (specific intent) or reasonable (general); law – generally no defense unless statute unpublished, official interpretation, or negates specific intent.
- **Mnemonics**: `DINE` (Duress elements); `INSANE` for insanity.
- **Traps**: Duress unavailable for murder; voluntary intoxication limited; entrapment fails if predisposed; mistaking age no defense to statutory rape.
- **Micro-Hypos**: Imperfect self-defense reduces murder; duress for murder fails; voluntary intoxication for general-intent crime fails; mistake-of-fact for larceny succeeds.

#### 8. Integration & Flowcharts
- **Flowcharts**: Homicide ladder; Fourth Amendment analysis; Miranda analysis; accomplice liability; defense availability.
- **Cross-Subject Connections**: Criminal procedure exclusion impacts proof of elements; evidence (hearsay, confrontation) intersects with procedure; constitutional defenses interact with substantive crimes.
- **Study Rhythm**: Use story-based campus (police station) and flowcharts to reinforce rule order.

## Evidence – Law Library & Courtroom

### Core Rule (25 words)
Evidence law governs admissibility by relevance, reliability, and policy exclusions, balancing probative value against prejudice, and protects privileges and constitutional confrontation rights.

### Story Method – "Gatekeeper Librarian"
Visualize a librarian-judge at the evidence desk deciding which books (evidence) enter the courtroom, checking foundation, hearsay, and privilege stamps.

### Major Topic Architecture
1. Relevance & Character Evidence
2. Hearsay & Exceptions
3. Witnesses & Impeachment

5. Authentication & Best Evidence

#### 1. Relevance
- **Mnemonic**: `403 Balance` – Probative vs unfair prejudice, confusion, waste.
- **Traps**: Subsequent remedial measures, settlements, offers to pay medical expenses, character evidence in civil vs criminal.
- **Preliminary Questions (FRE 104)**: Judge decides admissibility (preponderance); conditional relevance (104(b)) lets jury decide if condition met.
- **Limiting Instructions (FRE 105)**: Court must instruct jury on limited purpose/party if requested.
- **Rule of Completeness (FRE 106)**: Opponent may require introduction of remainder/related writings or statements for fairness.

- **Best Evidence Flex**: FRE 1007 allows proving contents via opponent’s testimony/deposition without original.
- **Digital Authentication**: Hash values, metadata, 902(13)/(14) certifications for automated electronic data; chain-of-custody important for fungible evidence.
- **Updated Prior Consistent Statements**: FRE 801(d)(1)(B)(ii) allows prior consistent statements to rehabilitate credibility even if made after alleged motive/joint attack.
- **Privilege Waiver (FRE 502)**: Subject-matter waiver only when intentional disclosure and fairness so requires; inadvertent disclosure does not waive if reasonable steps to prevent/correct.
