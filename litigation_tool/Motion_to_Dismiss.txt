IN THE IOWA DISTRICT COURT
FOR WOODBURY COUNTY

Jane Doe,
    Plaintiff,

vs.                                 Case No. LACV123456

John Smith,
    Defendant.

MOTION TO DISMISS


COMES NOW Defendant John Smith, by and through undersigned counsel, and respectfully moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.421, and in support states:

I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Complaint is deficient in the following respects:

   • The Complaint fails to allege that Defendant owed Plaintiff any duty of care
   • The Complaint contains no factual allegations of breach
   • The Complaint fails to allege causation
   • Damages are pled conclusorily without factual support

For these reasons, the Complaint should be dismissed.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Procedural Standard - Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.421

A complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Plausibility requires more than mere possibility that defendant acted unlawfully.

IMPORTANT: Iowa employs notice pleading and has NOT adopted the heightened federal Twombly/Iqbal plausibility standard.

B. Substantive Law - Negligence Elements

To state a claim for negligence, plaintiff must allege:
   (1) Duty
   (2) Breach
   (3) Causation (actual and proximate)
   (4) Damages

To establish negligence, plaintiff must prove: (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach was the actual and proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries; and (4) plaintiff suffered damages.

Here, the Complaint fails to adequately allege these elements, as detailed below.


III. ARGUMENT

The Complaint fails to establish the essential elements of negligence. As detailed above, negligence requires proof of: (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4) damages.

A. No Duty Alleged

The Complaint fails to allege that Defendant owed any duty of care to Plaintiff. Without a duty, there can be no negligence claim.

B. No Breach Alleged

Even if a duty existed, the Complaint contains no factual allegations showing that Defendant breached that duty. Conclusory allegations are insufficient.

C. No Causation

The Complaint fails to allege either actual cause (but-for causation) or proximate cause. There are no facts showing that Defendant's alleged conduct caused Plaintiff's alleged injuries.

D. Damages

The Complaint alleges only that Plaintiff suffered "damages" without any specific factual allegations regarding the nature or extent of those damages.

Because Plaintiff has failed to plead each element of negligence, the Complaint must be dismissed.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court GRANT this Motion and DISMISS Plaintiff's Complaint.

Respectfully submitted,
