## MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS (MCQs)

### 1. RECORDING ACTS

A) A wins because B had inquiry notice
B) B wins because A failed to record
C) A wins because B had constructive notice
D) B wins but only if B pays value

**Why B is right:** Race-notice statute protects first bona fide purchaser who records without notice.
**Why C is closest wrong:** Constructive notice doesn't defeat BFP under race-notice; actual notice does.

### 2. EASEMENTS - APPURTENANT VS IN GROSS

A) Easement in gross because it benefits Grantee's land
B) Appurtenant easement because it benefits Grantee's land
C) License because it's revocable
D) Prescriptive easement because it's for irrigation

**Why B is right:** "Right to use" language + benefits specific land = appurtenant easement.
**Why A is closest wrong:** In gross benefits individuals; appurtenant benefits the land itself.

B) All three become tenants in common

D) Joint tenancy continues unchanged

**Why B is closest wrong:** Conveyance severs joint tenancy; now tenancy in common among A, B, C.
**Why D is closest wrong:** Severance destroys joint tenancy regardless of intent.

### 4. LANDLORD-TENANT - IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY
Tenant leases apartment. Landlord fails to fix broken heater in winter. Tenant may:
A) Withhold all rent until fixed
B) Repair and deduct reasonable costs
C) Terminate lease immediately
D) Do nothing; breach doesn't affect rent duty

**Why B is right:** Repair-and-deduct is valid remedy for breach of implied warranty of habitability.
**Why A is closest wrong:** Cannot withhold all rent; must pay into court or escrow.

### 5. MORTGAGES - PURCHASE MONEY PRIORITY

A) Bank has priority over entire $250K
B) Credit Union has priority over entire $250K
C) Bank has priority over $200K; Credit Union over $50K
D) Equal priority; pro-rata distribution

**Why C is right:** Purchase money mortgage has super-priority over later liens on same collateral.
**Why B is closest wrong:** Later liens don't beat purchase money mortgages.

### 6. ADVERSE POSSESSION - COLOR OF TITLE

A) Gains title; 15 years sufficient
B) No title; forged deed invalid
C) Gains title; color of title reduces to 7 years
D) No title; must be 20 years minimum

**Why C is right:** Color of title reduces statutory period to 7 years if other elements met.
**Why A is closest wrong:** Without color of title, 20 years required; forged deed may not qualify.

A) Oven becomes landlord's property
B) Tenant may remove if done without damage
C) Oven belongs to tenant regardless

Grantor conveys "to A so long as used for residential purposes." This creates:
A) Fee simple subject to condition subsequent
B) Fee simple determinable
C) Executory limitation
D) Life estate

**Why B is right:** "So long as" creates fee simple determinable with automatic termination.
**Why A is closest wrong:** "But if" creates subject to condition subsequent requiring manual reentry.

### 9. COVENANTS - REAL VS EQUITABLE SERVITUDES

Dominant owner stops using easement for 20 years, plants garden over path. Servient owner:
A) May block path; easement abandoned
B) Cannot block; 20 years insufficient
C) May block only if adverse use proven
D) Cannot block; intent to abandon missing

**Why A is right:** Non-use + affirmative acts (garden) + intent = abandonment terminates easement.

### 12. RECORDING - WILD DEEDS
O conveys to A but deed never delivered. A records anyway. O conveys to B who records. Winner:
A) A wins; recorded first
B) B wins; bona fide purchaser
C) A wins; wild deed ineffective

A) Valid; landlord can terminate anytime
B) Invalid; retaliatory eviction prohibited
C) Valid if landlord fixes violations first
D) Invalid only if tenant withholds rent

A) Valid; transfer of ownership
B) Invalid; not arms-length sale

## MINI ISSUE-SPOTS

### 1. RECORDING - CHAIN OF TITLE
O owns Blackacre. O → A (recorded). A → B (unrecorded). A → C (recorded). B claims superior title to C.

**Rule:** Chain of title doctrine requires examining entire chain; unrecorded links break constructive notice.
**Key Fact:** B's unrecorded deed from A breaks chain; C can't claim inquiry notice.
**Outcome:** C wins as bona fide purchaser; broken chain prevents constructive notice of B's interest.

### 2. EASEMENTS - PRESCRIPTION ELEMENTS
Neighbor uses your driveway for 15 years openly, exclusively, continuously, claiming ownership.

**Rule:** Prescriptive easement requires hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous possession for statutory period.
**Key Fact:** Claiming ownership makes use hostile; all elements satisfied for 15 years.
**Outcome:** Neighbor gains prescriptive easement; not adverse possession (no intent to own land).

### 3. CONCURRENT - PARTITION ACTION
A and B own Blackacre as tenants in common, 50/50. A wants to sell; B wants to keep. A files partition.

**Rule:** Tenants in common have right to partition; court can order partition in kind or forced sale.
**Key Fact:** Partition terminates concurrent ownership; no survivorship rights in tenancy in common.
**Outcome:** Court orders partition by sale; proceeds divided equally between A and B.

### 4. LL-T - CONSTRUCTIVE EVICTION
Landlord changes locks after tenant complains about rats. Tenant can't re-enter for 3 days.

**Rule:** Constructive eviction occurs when landlord makes premises uninhabitable or denies access.
**Key Fact:** Lock-out after complaint creates constructive eviction; tenant may terminate and stop rent.
**Outcome:** Tenant may treat lease as ended; landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment.

### 5. MORTGAGES - FORECLOSURE DEFICIENCY
Mortgage $100K on property worth $80K. Lender forecloses, buys at auction for $60K. Deficiency judgment?

**Rule:** Deficiency judgment allowed for difference between debt and foreclosure sale price.
**Key Fact:** Property worth less than debt; fair sale price below market value.
**Outcome:** Lender gets $40K deficiency judgment against borrower (anti-deficiency statutes may limit).

### 6. ADVERSE POSSESSION - TACKING
Parent adversely possesses land for 10 years, then conveys to adult child who continues for 8 more years.

**Rule:** Tacking allows successive adverse possessors to combine time periods if privity of estate.
**Key Fact:** Parent-child conveyance creates privity; continuous possession under same claim.
**Outcome:** Combined 18 years satisfies 20-year requirement; child gains title by adverse possession.

### 7. FIXTURES - INTENT TEST
Homeowner installs central air conditioning system costing $10K, permanently attached to house.

**Rule:** Fixtures become real property when attached with intent to permanently improve the realty.
**Key Fact:** Expensive system intended for permanent use; removal would damage house structure.
**Outcome:** Air conditioning becomes fixture; transfers with property sale despite being removable.

### 8. ESTATES - RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES
Grantor conveys "to A for life, then to A's children who reach age 25."

**Rule:** Interests must vest or fail within 21 years of life in being; contingent interests analyzed.
**Key Fact:** Children's interest contingent on surviving to age 25; could vest beyond perpetuities period.
**Outcome:** Valid; "wait and see" doctrine saves if all children reach 25 within period.

### 9. SERVITUDES - NOTICE REQUIREMENT
Original covenant promises "no commercial use." Successor buys with actual knowledge but no recorded notice.

**Rule:** Equitable servitudes require intent, notice, touch & concern; actual knowledge satisfies notice.
**Key Fact:** Buyer had actual knowledge of restriction; no recording required for servitudes.
**Outcome:** Servitude enforceable against successor; actual notice substitutes for recording.

### 10. ZONING - VARIANCE
Property owner seeks variance to build garage closer to lot line than zoning allows.

**Rule:** Variance requires showing hardship; cannot be granted solely for convenience or profit.
**Key Fact:** Owner claims unique hardship due to lot shape; no reasonable use otherwise.
**Outcome:** Variance granted if genuine hardship proven; spot zoning if granted without standards.
