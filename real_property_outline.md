## 🏰 1. ESTATES & FUTURE INTERESTS

**Rule (22 words):** Present possessory estates include fee simple absolute, defeasible fees, and life estates; future interests include reversions, remainders, and executory interests that must satisfy RAP.

**🎭 Story Method - "The Royal Castle Succession":**
Imagine a medieval castle with a king who must decide succession. The KING has present possession (present estate), but he's planning for HEIRS (future interests). Some heirs get the castle automatically (vested), others only if conditions are met (contingent), and some lose it if they break rules (defeasible).

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Fee Simple Absolute:** "To A and heirs" - lasts forever, most comprehensive estate
- **Life Estates:** Measured by life of holder or another (pur autre vie)
- **Defeasible Fees:** Determinable, subject to condition subsequent, executory limitation
- **Future Interests:** Reversions, remainders (vested/contingent), executory interests
- **Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP):** Must vest within 21 years of life in being
- **Class Gifts:** "To A's children" - vests immediately but interests contingent

**🎵 Rhythmic Mnemonic: "PREFUR" Elements:**
*(Sing to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star")*
- **P**resent possessory estate (now) 🎵
- **R**emainder (to third party after life estate) 🎵
- **E**xecutory interest (springs on condition) 🎵
- **F**ee simple defeasible (determinable/subject to/executory limitation) 🎵
- **U**ltimate reversion (back to grantor) 🎵
- **R**ule against perpetuities (21-year limit) 🎵

**🤲 Kinesthetic Memory (Hand Gestures):**
- **Present Estate:** Hold object in hands (you have it now)
- **Future Interest:** Point forward (coming later)
- **Vested Remainder:** Firm handshake (guaranteed)
- **Contingent Remainder:** Crossed fingers (depends on condition)
- **Reversion:** Boomerang motion (comes back to grantor)

**🎨 Visual ASCII - Estate Timeline:**
```
PRESENT ────────────────► FUTURE
  NOW         CONDITION      LATER
  👑          ❓            👑👑👑
GRANTOR   →   EVENT    →   HEIRS
(has it)     (maybe)      (might get)
```

**🚨 Most-Tested Pitfalls (Memory Hooks):**
- **"AUTO vs. MANUAL":** Determinable = AUTOmatic (like autopilot); Condition Subsequent = MANUAL reentry (like manual transmission)
- **"REMAINDER RULE":** Remainders are like train passengers - they wait for their turn, never jump ahead (never executory)
- **"RAP TRAP":** 21 years + lives in being = drinking age (21) + pregnancy (gestation)

**🎯 Micro-Hypos with Memorable Contexts:**

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean Family):** Grantor conveys "to A for life, then to B." 
→ A has life estate, B has vested remainder.
*Memory: Simple family succession - dad to son*

**Micro-Hypo 2 (Marriage Trap):** Grantor conveys "to A so long as A never marries." 
→ A has fee simple determinable; grantor retains possibility of reverter.
*Memory: Controlling parent - automatic loss if A marries*

**Micro-Hypo 3 (Kids Waiting):** "To A for life, then to A's children." 
→ A has life estate; children have contingent remainder.
*Memory: Kids wait to inherit, but only if they exist*

**Micro-Hypo 4 (Heirs Trick):** "To A for life, then to A's heirs." 
→ A has life estate; "heirs" creates reversion to grantor.
*Memory: "Heirs" is a magic word that means "back to grantor"*

**✨ Magic Words (Spell-Casting Phrases):**
- **"So long as"** = 🪄 POOF! Gone automatically (determinable)
- **"But if"** = 🔑 Must use key to get back (condition subsequent)
- **"Provided that"** = 🎁 Gift goes to someone else (executory)
- **"Then to"** = 🚂 Next train car (remainder)
- **"To heirs"** = 🪃 Boomerang back (reversion)

**🎯 3-Step Drill (The "NOW-LATER-MAYBE" Method):**
1. **🕐 NOW or LATER?** Present possession (NOW) or future interest (LATER)?
2. **📋 APPLY PREFUR:** Which type fits the pattern?
3. **⚠️ RAP CHECK:** If contingent future interest, does it vest within RAP period?

**⏰ RAP Application ("The 21-Year Pregnancy Rule"):**
- **👶 Lives in being:** People alive when interest created + unborn children
- **🍺 21 years:** After death of last life in being (drinking age memory)
- **🤱 Period of gestation:** 280 days for unborn children (pregnancy period)
- **⏳ Wait and see doctrine:** [MBE Split] Some states save interests that vest within period

**🔍 Advanced Memory Techniques:**

**🎪 "Estate Circus" Visualization:**
- **Fee Simple Absolute** = 🎪 Big Top (covers everything forever)
- **Life Estate** = 🎠 Carousel (goes around until music stops)
- **Determinable** = 🎢 Roller coaster (automatic drop when condition hits)
- **Condition Subsequent** = 🎯 Dart game (must throw dart to win back)
- **Executory** = 🎁 Pass-the-gift (automatically goes to next person)

**🗣️ Alliterative Memory Aids:**
- **"Determinable Drops Directly"** (automatic termination)
- **"Subsequent Seeks Specific Steps"** (manual reentry required)
- **"Executory Exits to External party"** (third party gets it)
- **"Remainder Requires Relationship"** (to third party)
- **"Reversion Returns to oRiginal grantor"**

**🎮 Gamification - "Estate Battle Royale":**
Each estate type is a character with special powers:
- **Fee Simple Absolute:** 💪 Strongest - can't be defeated
- **Life Estate:** ⏳ Time-limited - disappears when timer runs out
- **Determinable:** ⚡ Auto-defeat when condition triggered
- **Condition Subsequent:** 🛡️ Can be defeated but must be attacked
- **Executory:** 🔄 Transfers power to ally when condition met

**🧠 Trap Radar (Enhanced with Memory Hooks):**
- **"Heirs = Boomerang":** "To A's heirs" always returns to grantor
- **"Words of Art vs. Words of Purchase":** "And heirs" = fee simple (not required anymore)
- **"Pur Autre Vie = French for 'For Another's Life'":** Measured by someone else's lifespan
- **"Class = Contingent Until Closed":** Children's class stays open until parent dies
- **"RAP = No Remote Vesting":** Can't vest too far in future (21 years max)
- **"Charity Exemption":** Charitable interests exempt from RAP
- **"Shifting vs. Springing":** Shifting cuts short prior estate; Springing fills gap

## 📜 2. CONVEYANCING & RECORDING

**Rule (20 words):** Recording statutes protect bona fide purchasers; race-notice is majority rule, requiring timely recordation without notice of prior interests.

**🏛️ Story Method - "The Medieval Deed Registry":**
Imagine a medieval kingdom where the KING'S SCRIBE maintains the official DEED REGISTRY in the castle tower. Nobles race to register their land purchases first. The scribe protects honest buyers (BFP) but cannot help those who knew about prior claims or received forged documents.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Deed Types:** Warranty, special warranty, bargain & sale, quitclaim
- **Marketable Title:** Insurable title free of reasonable defects
- **Title Insurance:** Protects against title defects and off-record risks
- **After-Acquired Title:** Doctrine that validates defective conveyances
- **Recording Acts:** Race, notice, race-notice (majority)
- **Chain of Title:** Must examine entire chain for breaks

**🏃‍♂️ Athletic Mnemonic: "RACE to the Courthouse":**
*(Imagine runners in a race to record deeds)*
- **R**ace = 🏃‍♂️ First to finish line (courthouse) wins
- **A**ctual notice = 👀 If you SAW the other runner, you lose
- **C**onstructive notice = 📋 If it's on the scoreboard (recorded), you lose
- **E**xception = 🚫 Cheaters (wild/forged deeds) disqualified

**🎨 Visual ASCII - Recording Race:**
```
🏃‍♂️A ────► 🏛️ COURTHOUSE ◄──── 🏃‍♂️B
BUYER A         RECORDING         BUYER B
(knows nothing) SYSTEM           (saw A's deed)
   ↓                               ↓
  WINS!                          LOSES
```

**🚨 Most-Tested Pitfalls (Memory Hooks):**
- **"BFP = Good Faith Penny":** Bona fide purchaser needs good faith + value (even $1) + no notice
- **"Chain Gang":** Must examine entire chain of title, not just immediate grantor (like prison chain gang - all connected)
- **"Triple Notice Threat":** Actual (you know) + Constructive (recorded) + Inquiry (should have known)

**🎯 Micro-Hypos with Memorable Contexts:**

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Honest Race):** O conveys to A; A records. O then conveys to BFP who records without notice. 
→ BFP wins under race-notice.
*Memory: Honest buyer wins the race to courthouse*

**Micro-Hypo 2 (Cheating Buyer):** O conveys to A; A doesn't record. O conveys to B who knows of A's interest. 
→ A wins; B has notice.
*Memory: Cheater (B) gets disqualified for knowing*

**Micro-Hypo 3 (Full Protection):** Warranty deed covenants seisin, quiet enjoyment, warranty, further assurances. 
→ Full protection against title defects.
*Memory: Warranty = full armor protection*

**Micro-Hypo 4 (Naked Risk):** Quitclaim deed transfers "whatever interest I have." 
→ No warranties, buyer takes risk.
*Memory: Quitclaim = naked deed (no protection)*

**🎪 "Deed Circus" Performances:**
- **Warranty Deed** = 🎪 Full circus (all acts guaranteed)
- **Special Warranty** = 🎠 Limited rides (only grantor's acts)
- **Bargain & Sale** = 🎫 Basic ticket (some protection)
- **Quitclaim** = 🚪 Exit door ("whatever you get, you get")

**✨ Magic Words (Legal Incantations):**
- **"Bona fide purchaser"** = 🛡️ Shield of protection (good faith + value + no notice)
- **"So long as"** = ⚡ Lightning protection (race-notice applies)
- **"Provided that"** = 🔍 Magnifying glass (notice defeats protection)
- **"Warranty deed"** = 🏰 Castle walls (covenants protect)
- **"Quitclaim deed"** = 🤷‍♀️ Shrug emoji ("whatever I have")

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify recording act (race/notice/race-notice)
2. **Rule:** Check BFP elements and timing
3. **Exception:** Notice or wild deed destroys protection

**Deed Validity Checklist:**
- Grantor competency and ownership
- Delivery and acceptance (intent to convey)
- Adequate description of property
- Consideration (not required but common)
- Signature (witnesses/notarization may be required)

**Recording Act Variations:**
- **Race:** First to record wins (Arkansas)
- **Notice:** No notice protects (Louisiana)
- **Race-notice:** First to record without notice wins (majority)

**Trap Radar:**
- Mortgage recording doesn't always protect priority (depends on jurisdiction)
- "Notice" includes actual knowledge, inquiry notice, and record notice
- Forged deeds are void, not voidable (even BFP can't claim)
- Delivery + acceptance required for deed validity
- Seal not required in most states
- After-acquired title doctrine validates defective deeds
- Title insurance covers off-record risks and survey defects
- Marketable title acts extinguish ancient claims

## 3. EASEMENTS, SERVITUDES & LICENSES

**Rule (21 words):** Easements create rights to use another's land; appurtenant easements run with land, in gross are personal; licenses are revocable permissions.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Appurtenant Easements:** Benefit dominant estate, run with land
- **Easements in Gross:** Personal to holder, don't run with land
- **Affirmative Easements:** Right to use (crossing, drainage)
- **Negative Easements:** Right to prevent use (light, air, support)
- **Creation Methods:** Express, prescription, implication, estoppel
- **Termination:** Merger, abandonment, release, prescription, condemnation
- **Scope of Rights:** Limited to original purpose and necessity

### **🎯 EQUITABLE SERVITUDES & COMMON SCHEMES**

**Rule (23 words):** Equitable servitudes implied from common scheme bind all lots if: (1) owner intended servitude on all lots, (2) servitude is restrictive, (3) person bound had notice.

**🏘️ Story Method - "The Master-Planned Community":**
Imagine a DEVELOPER who creates a beautiful master-planned community. Like a movie director with a VISION for the entire neighborhood, the developer wants ALL houses to follow the same script (restrictions). Even if some early buyers didn't get the full script in their contracts, they're still bound by the COMMON SCHEME if they had NOTICE of the overall plan.

**🎪 "Common Scheme Circus" Elements:**
- **Ring Master's Intent:** 🎭 Developer intended restrictions on ALL lots in subdivision
- **Restrictive Performance:** 🚫 Servitude prevents certain uses (not grants rights)  
- **Audience Notice:** 👀 Successor had actual, record, or inquiry notice of restrictions

**✨ Magic Words for Common Schemes:**
- **"Common scheme"** = 🗺️ Uniform plan for entire development
- **"Implied reciprocal negative easement"** = 🔄 Restrictions bind all lots equally
- **"Notice of restrictions"** = 👁️ Knowledge (actual/constructive/inquiry)
- **"Intent to create servitude"** = 🎯 Developer's plan for all lots

**🚨 Most-Tested Common Scheme Pitfalls:**
- **"Early Bird Trap":** Even lots sold BEFORE restrictions were recorded can be bound by common scheme
- **"Notice Ninja":** Buyer doesn't need express restrictions in deed if they had notice of common scheme
- **"Intent Inspector":** Must prove developer intended restrictions on ALL lots, not just some

**🎯 Micro-Hypos for Common Schemes:**

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Early Sale Trap):** Developer subdivides 10 lots, sells Lot 1 without restrictions, then sells remaining 9 lots with "residential only" restrictions. Later buyer of Lot 1 opens business. 
→ If common scheme existed when Lot 1 was sold AND buyer had notice, restrictions bind Lot 1.
*Memory: Early bird still caught by the common scheme worm*

**Micro-Hypo 2 (Notice Test):** Buyer purchases lot with deed containing no restrictions, but sees "Residential Only" signs throughout subdivision and all neighboring houses are residential.
→ Inquiry notice sufficient to bind buyer to common scheme restrictions.
*Memory: Signs and patterns give notice - ignorance isn't bliss*

**Micro-Hypo 3 (Intent Proof):** Developer sells 5 of 10 lots with restrictions, keeps 5 unrestricted for potential commercial use.
→ No common scheme because developer didn't intend restrictions on ALL lots.
*Memory: Common scheme needs COMMON intent for all lots*

**📋 Common Scheme Requirements Checklist:**
1. **Intent to impose servitude on all lots** ✓
2. **Servitude must be restrictive** (negative) ✓  
3. **Person to be bound must have had notice** ✓
4. **Scheme must be "common" to entire development** ✓

**🎵 Memory Aids for Common Schemes:**

**🎭 "IRIS" Mnemonic for Common Scheme Elements:**
*(Sing to "Row, Row, Row Your Boat")*
- **I**ntent to impose on all lots 🎵
- **R**estrictive servitude only 🎵  
- **I**nquiry notice is enough 🎵
- **S**cheme must be common to all 🎵

**🤲 Kinesthetic Memory for Notice Types:**
- **Actual Notice:** 👀 Point to your eyes (you SAW it)
- **Record Notice:** 📋 Hold up papers (it's RECORDED)
- **Inquiry Notice:** 🤔 Tap your temple (reasonable person would ASK)

**🎨 Visual Memory - "The Subdivision Symphony":**
```
    🎼 DEVELOPER'S MASTER PLAN 🎼
    
Lot 1 → 🏠 (sold early, no deed restrictions)
Lot 2 → 🏠 + 📋 (deed says "residential only")  
Lot 3 → 🏠 + 📋 (deed says "residential only")
Lot 4 → 🏠 + 📋 (deed says "residential only")
...all playing the same song of restrictions...

Question: Can Lot 1 🏠 play a different tune? 🎵🏢
Answer: NO if the buyer had NOTICE of the common scheme! 🚫
```

**⚡ Speed Recognition Patterns:**
- **Early sale + later restrictions = Common scheme issue** 🚨
- **"Residential only" in subdivision = Look for scheme** 👀
- **Lot sold without restrictions = Check notice** 🔍
- **Developer sues buyer = Probably seeking injunction** ⚖️

**🎯 Advanced Trap Recognition:**

**"The Time Trap" 🕐:**
Don't think: "Lot 1 was sold first, so it can't be restricted"
DO think: "Was there intent for ALL lots + notice to buyer?"

**"The Recording Trap" 📋:**  
Don't think: "No restrictions in deed = no restrictions apply"
DO think: "Inquiry notice from surrounding development pattern?"

**"The Intent Trap" 🎯:**
Don't think: "Some restricted lots = common scheme"
DO think: "Did developer intend restrictions on ALL lots in scheme?"

**🏃‍♂️ "Three-Step Common Scheme Dance":**
1. **🎭 INTENT Check:** Did developer plan restrictions for ALL lots?
2. **👀 NOTICE Check:** Did buyer know (actual/record/inquiry)?
3. **🚫 RESTRICTIVE Check:** Does servitude prevent use (not grant)?
*If all three = YES, then restrictions bind! 🎉*

**Mnemonic: "EASE" Creation Methods:**
- **E**xpress (written agreement)
- **A**dverse use (prescription: hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous)
- **S**tatutory implication (necessity or prior use)
- **E**stoppel (detrimental reliance)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Appurtenant easements require dominant/servient estates; in gross easements benefit individuals
- Termination by merger, abandonment, release, or condemnation
- Scope limited to original purpose and necessity

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor conveys land with "right to cross Grantor's adjacent lot." → Appurtenant easement created.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway for 20 years openly. → Prescriptive easement if all elements met.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Landlocked parcel; owner gains easement by necessity across neighbor's land. → Implied easement by necessity.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Utility company has easement in gross for power lines. → Doesn't run with company's land transfers.

**Magic Words:**
- **Appurtenant to** = runs with dominant estate
- **In gross** = personal to holder, doesn't run
- **Provided that** = all prescription elements satisfied
- **Way of necessity** = easement by implication for landlocked parcels

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as easement (property interest) vs. license (personal)
2. **Rule:** Check creation method and type (appurtenant/in gross)
3. **Exception:** Termination methods or statute of limitations

**Creation Methods Detail:**
- **Express:** Must be in writing; oral agreements = license
- **Prescription:** Hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous, statutory period
- **Implication:** Prior use + continuous + reasonable necessity
- **Estoppel:** Promise + reasonable reliance + injustice to deny

**Termination Methods:**
- **Merger:** Same person owns both dominant and servient estates
- **Abandonment:** Non-use + intent to abandon (affirmative acts help)
- **Release:** Written relinquishment of easement rights
- **Prescription:** Adverse use against easement holder
- **Condemnation:** Government takes easement for public use

**Trap Radar:**
- Affirmative easements (right to do something) vs. negative (right to prevent)
- Easements by implication require strict necessity
- "Way of necessity" arises from landlocked parcels
- Written requirement for express easements (oral = license)
- Scope limited to original purpose and necessity
- Negative easements harder to establish (writing usually required)
- Utility easements often in gross (personal to utility)
- Easement scope determined by original intent and necessity
- "Floating easements" shift with land development

## 4. CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP

**Rule (20 words):** Joint tenancy requires four unities; tenancy in common has no survivorship; tenancy by entirety protects marital property from separate creditors.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Joint Tenancy:** Right of survivorship, four unities required
- **Tenancy in Common:** No survivorship, unequal shares allowed
- **Tenancy by Entirety:** Marital property, creditor protection
- **Severance:** Methods that destroy joint tenancy
- **Partition:** Court-ordered division (in kind or by sale)
- **Creditor Rights:** Against joint tenant interests

**Mnemonic: "TIE" Unities:**
- **T**ime (same moment acquired)
- **I**nterest (equal shares)
- **E**ntirety (whole property undivided)
- Plus **P**ossession (shared use rights)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Severance destroys joint tenancy (conveyance, mortgage, or partition action)
- Presumption favors tenancy in common unless four unities proven
- Tenancy by entirety protects against separate creditors only

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** "To A and B as joint tenants." → Right of survivorship applies.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Joint tenants A and B; A conveys interest to C. → Severance; now tenancy in common.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Married owners A and B; A's creditor gets judgment. → Cannot attach to entirety property.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Joint tenants A and B; A mortgages interest. → [MBE Split] May or may not sever depending on jurisdiction.

**Magic Words:**
- **Joint tenants** = survivorship applies
- **Tenants in common** = no survivorship
- **Provided that** = all four unities present
- **Tenancy by entirety** = marital creditor protection

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Count unities present
2. **Rule:** Apply survivorship or equal shares
3. **Exception:** Severance methods destroy joint tenancy

**Severance Methods:**
- **Conveyance:** Joint tenant transfers interest to third party
- **Mortgage:** [MBE Split] Some states sever, others don't
- **Partition:** Court action terminates concurrent ownership
- **Death:** Triggers survivorship, doesn't "sever" the tenancy

**Partition Types:**
- **In kind:** Physical division of property
- **By sale:** Court orders sale, divides proceeds
- **Owelty:** Monetary adjustment for unequal division

**Creditor Rights:**
- **Joint Tenancy:** Creditor can reach debtor's interest only
- **Tenancy in Common:** Creditor can force partition and sale
- **Tenancy by Entirety:** Protected from separate creditors
- **Joint Debtor:** Both spouses liable on joint debts

**Trap Radar:**
- Partition in kind vs. partition by sale
- Creditor's rights against joint tenant's interest
- "Heirs and assigns" doesn't create joint tenancy
- Tenancy by entirety requires valid marriage
- Death of joint tenant doesn't "sever" - it triggers survivorship
- Mortgage severance [MBE Split] between jurisdictions
- Presumption of tenancy in common when unities missing
- "Joint tenancy" language doesn't overcome missing unities
- Creditor of one joint tenant cannot force partition

## 5. LANDLORD-TENANT LAW

**Rule (21 words):** Landlord must maintain habitable premises; tenant must pay rent; holdover becomes periodic tenancy; self-help eviction is illegal in most states.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Implied Warranty of Habitability:** Landlord duty to maintain safe premises
- **Quiet Enjoyment:** Right to undisturbed possession
- **Retaliatory Evictions:** Illegal to evict for exercising tenant rights
- **Security Deposits:** Limits, return requirements, deductions
- **Assignment vs. Sublease:** Transfer of lease rights
- **Holdover Tenants:** Periodic tenancy rules

**Mnemonic: "RENT" Duties:**
- **R**epairs (landlord: major; tenant: minor)
- **E**xclusive possession (quiet enjoyment)
- **N**o retaliation (for complaints)
- **T**enant duties (pay rent, reasonable care)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Implied warranty of habitability applies to residential leases
- Retaliatory eviction (evicting for exercising tenant rights) is illegal
- Security deposit rules vary by jurisdiction

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Landlord fails to fix leaky roof; tenant withholds rent. → Valid repair-and-deduct.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Tenant complains about code violations; landlord evicts. → Retaliatory eviction (invalid).
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Tenant assigns entire lease to third party. → Assignee liable to landlord; original tenant remains secondarily liable.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Month-to-month tenant holds over after lease expires. → Becomes periodic tenant; landlord can terminate with notice.

**Magic Words:**
- **Warranty of habitability** = landlord's duty to maintain
- **Quiet enjoyment** = tenant's right to undisturbed possession
- **Provided that** = tenant pays rent timely
- **Retaliatory eviction** = illegal for tenant complaints

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify breach (landlord vs. tenant duty)
2. **Rule:** Apply habitability or quiet enjoyment
3. **Exception:** Retaliatory eviction or self-help defenses

**Warranty of Habitability Elements:**
- **Structural components:** Roof, walls, floors, windows
- **Plumbing:** Working fixtures, hot water, sewage
- **Heating:** Adequate heat in winter
- **Safe conditions:** No code violations, pest-free
- **Residential only:** Doesn't apply to commercial leases

**Tenant Remedies for Breach:**
- **Repair and deduct:** Withhold rent for repairs
- **Terminate lease:** Move out and stop rent
- **Sue for damages:** Breach of contract
- **Injunctive relief:** Court order to fix problems

**Security Deposit Rules:**
- **Limits:** Usually 1-2 months' rent
- **Return time:** 30 days after lease ends
- **Deductions:** Only for actual damages
- **Interest:** [MBE Split] Some states require payment
- **Itemization:** Must provide written explanation

**Assignment vs. Sublease:**
- **Assignment:** Transfer of entire lease interest
- **Sublease:** Transfer of portion of lease term
- **Privity:** Assignment creates privity of estate with landlord
- **Liability:** Original tenant remains liable in both cases

**Trap Radar:**
- Commercial vs. residential lease standards
- "Month-to-month" presumption for periodic tenancies
- Landlord's right to re-enter for non-payment
- Tenant's abandonment requires landlord's acceptance
- Security deposit limits and return requirements
- Retaliatory eviction timing (must be within reasonable time)
- Constructive eviction requires landlord knowledge and opportunity to cure
- "Repair and deduct" requires proper notice to landlord
- Landlord cannot waive warranty of habitability

## 6. MORTGAGES, FORECLOSURE & PRIORITY

**Rule (20 words):** Mortgage creates security interest; foreclosure terminates mortgagor's equity; purchase money mortgages have super-priority over later liens on same collateral.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Mortgage vs. Deed of Trust:** Title transfer differences
- **Foreclosure Process:** Judicial vs. non-judicial
- **Deficiency Judgments:** Recovery of unpaid balance
- **Due-on-Sale Clauses:** Acceleration upon transfer
- **Purchase Money Priority:** Construction and acquisition loans
- **Junior Liens:** Survival after senior foreclosure

**Mnemonic: "MORT" Priority:**
- **M**ortgage (security interest)
- **O**riginal purchase money (highest priority)
- **R**ecordation timing (first in time, first in right)
- **T**ax liens (special priority status)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Purchase money mortgages beat subsequent liens on same property
- Mortgage doesn't transfer title (deed of trust does)
- Deficiency judgments vary by state (anti-deficiency statutes)

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Buyer borrows $100K to purchase home; later borrows $50K for renovations. → Purchase money has priority.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Buyer borrows for purchase; seller takes back mortgage. → Still purchase money priority.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Mortgage with due-on-sale; buyer transfers property. → Lender can accelerate full balance.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Senior mortgage forecloses; junior lien survives. → Junior liens usually survive senior foreclosure.

**Magic Words:**
- **Purchase money** = super-priority over junior liens
- **First in time** = first in right (absent fraud)
- **Provided that** = recorded properly
- **Due-on-sale** = acceleration clause triggered

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify lien type (purchase money vs. later)
2. **Rule:** Apply priority rules
3. **Exception:** Fraud or statutory exceptions

**Mortgage Types:**
- **Mortgage:** Security interest; borrower retains title
- **Deed of Trust:** Trustee holds title as security
- **Purchase Money:** Loan for acquisition or construction
- **Construction:** Funds used for building improvements

**Foreclosure Process:**
- **Judicial:** Court-supervised sale
- **Non-judicial:** Trustee sale (deeds of trust)
- **Strict Foreclosure:** [MBE Split] Some states allow
- **Redemption:** Right to repurchase before sale

**Deficiency Judgments:**
- **Allowed:** If foreclosure sale < debt amount
- **Anti-deficiency:** [MBE Split] Purchase money protection
- **One-action rule:** California prevents deficiency
- **Fair value:** Some states limit to fair market value

**Purchase Money Priority:**
- **Acquisition:** Loan to purchase the property
- **Construction:** Funds used for building/improvements
- **Super-priority:** Beats all subsequent liens
- **Recording:** Must be properly recorded

**Trap Radar:**
- Due-on-sale clauses triggered by transfers
- Deficiency judgments after foreclosure
- Mortgage vs. deed of trust differences
- Junior liens survive senior foreclosure
- Recording doesn't perfect unrecorded mortgages
- Purchase money priority applies to same collateral only
- Construction loans require funds used for construction
- Due-on-sale enforceable despite transfer restrictions
- Redemption rights vary by state and mortgage type

## 7. ZONING & TAKINGS

**Rule (20 words):** Zoning regulates land use; takings require just compensation; variance is exception to zoning rules for hardship; exactions must be roughly proportional.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Zoning Ordinances:** Comprehensive land use regulation
- **Variances & Special Permits:** Exceptions to zoning rules
- **Physical vs. Regulatory Takings:** Government actions requiring compensation
- **Exactions:** Development conditions (Nollan/Dolan test)
- **Inverse Condemnation:** Damages from government action
- **Substantive Due Process:** Zoning must be reasonable

**Mnemonic: "ZONE" Elements:**
- **Z**oning ordinance (comprehensive plan)
- **O**wnership rights (police power limited)
- **N**o compensation unless taking
- **E**xceptions (variance, special use permit)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Physical taking (invasion) vs. regulatory taking (diminution in value)
- Spot zoning (single parcel change) is invalid unless comprehensive
- Exactions must satisfy "rough proportionality" test

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** City zones residential; property owner gets variance for home business. → Valid if meets criteria.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** City downzones property 50% value reduction. → Possible regulatory taking requiring compensation.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** City requires park dedication for subdivision approval. → Valid exaction if roughly proportional.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Government condemns land for private project. → Invalid public use requirement.

**Magic Words:**
- **Spot zoning** = invalid unless comprehensive
- **Regulatory taking** = compensation required
- **Provided that** = legitimate government interest
- **Rough proportionality** = exaction must be related to impact

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as zoning or taking issue
2. **Rule:** Apply police power or compensation
3. **Exception:** Variance or special permit procedures

**Zoning Requirements:**
- **Comprehensive:** City-wide plan, not spot zoning
- **Reasonable:** Not arbitrary or capricious
- **Uniform:** Similar properties treated similarly
- **Due Process:** Notice and hearing requirements

**Variance Standards:**
- **Hardship:** Unique to the property
- **Not self-created:** Owner didn't cause the hardship
- **Substantial:** Significant impact on property use
- **Neighborhood:** Won't substantially affect surrounding area

**Physical Takings:**
- **Direct invasion:** Government physically occupies land
- **Permanent easement:** Continuous government use
- **Temporary:** May require compensation
- **Inverse condemnation:** Government action damages property

**Regulatory Takings:**
- **Penn Central factors:** Economic impact, investment-backed expectations, character of government action
- **Total taking:** Regulation eliminates all economic value
- **Categorical:** Certain regulations per se takings
- **Temporary:** Takings during project delays

**Exactions (Nollan/Dolan):**
- **Essential nexus:** Exaction must relate to development impact
- **Rough proportionality:** Cost reasonably related to benefit
- **Dedications:** Land or money for public improvements
- **Impact fees:** Per-unit charges for infrastructure

**Trap Radar:**
- Nollan/Dolan "rough proportionality" test
- Temporary takings during project delays
- Exactions must be related to development impact
- Moratoria don't require compensation if reasonable
- Transferable development rights
- Spot zoning invalid even if reasonable
- Regulatory takings require significant diminution in value
- Public use requirement for eminent domain
- Substantive due process limits zoning power
- Floating zones must have definite standards

## 8. ADVERSE POSSESSION

**Rule (19 words):** Hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous possession for statutory period perfects title; color of title reduces period to 7 years.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Elements Required:** HATE (hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous)
- **Color of Title:** Written document reducing statutory period
- **Tacking:** Combining successive possessors' time
- **Disabilities:** Tolling the statute (minority, insanity)
- **Boundary Disputes:** Specific rules for fence/line cases
- **Government Immunity:** Public property cannot be adversely possessed

**Mnemonic: "HATE" Elements:**
- **H**ostile (without permission)
- **A**ctual (physical possession)
- **T**ax payment (often required)
- **E**xclusive (no sharing with true owner)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Tacking (successive adverse possessors combine time)
- Color of title reduces statutory period to 7 years
- Hostile doesn't require ill intent

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Squatter openly farms vacant lot for 20 years. → Gains title by adverse possession.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway openly for 15 years. → Prescriptive easement, not adverse possession.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Parent adversely possesses for 10 years, conveys to child who continues for 8 more. → Tacking allowed; total 18 years.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Adverse possessor is mentally incompetent for 5 years during possession. → Statute tolled; total time counts.

**Magic Words:**
- **Color of title** = 7-year period
- **Tacking allowed** = combine possession periods
- **Provided that** = all elements satisfied
- **Disability tolls** = stops statute from running

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Check possession vs. easement
2. **Rule:** Verify HATE elements
3. **Exception:** Disabilities or color of title

**HATE Elements Detail:**
- **Hostile:** Without owner's permission (not ill intent)
- **Actual:** Physical use and control of the land
- **Exclusive:** Possessor treats land as their own
- **Continuous:** Uninterrupted for statutory period
- **Statutory Period:** Usually 20 years (7 with color of title)

**Color of Title Requirements:**
- **Written instrument:** Deed, will, or court order
- **Describes the land:** Adequate legal description
- **In chain of title:** Connects to adverse possessor's claim
- **Reduces period:** From 20 to 7 years in most states

**Tacking Rules:**
- **Privity of estate:** Successor must get interest from prior possessor
- **Same hostile claim:** Continuous adverse use under same theory
- **No breaks:** Each possessor must satisfy elements
- **Disabilities:** Don't prevent tacking

**Disabilities That Toll:**
- **Minority:** Under age of majority (usually 18)
- **Insanity:** Mental incapacity preventing legal action
- **Imprisonment:** [MBE Split] Some states toll for prisoners
- **War:** Military service may toll statute

**Boundary Disputes:**
- **Good faith improvement:** Reliance on survey or monuments
- **AGREED boundaries:** Lines established by neighbors
- **Adverse possession:** Shorter period (often 10 years)
- **Color of title:** Not required for boundary disputes

**Trap Radar:**
- Hostile doesn't require ill intent (just without permission)
- "Claim of right" not required in many jurisdictions
- Disabilities (minority, insanity) toll statute
- Government property immune to adverse possession
- Boundary disputes require specific elements
- Color of title must be in possessor's chain of title
- Tacking requires privity between successive possessors
- "Open and notorious" is presumed if no interruption
- Disabilities toll only during the disability period
- Tax payment not required in all jurisdictions

## 9. FIXTURES

**Rule (18 words):** Personal property becomes real property when permanently attached with intent to improve the realty; trade fixtures remain personal property.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **FIX Test:** Fastened + Intent + eXtent of attachment
- **Trade Fixtures:** Business equipment removable by tenant
- **Mortgage Rights:** Fixtures attached during mortgage term
- **Severance:** Removal may or may not restore personal property
- **Agricultural Fixtures:** Special rules for farming equipment
- **Building Materials:** Become fixtures when incorporated

**Mnemonic: "FIX" Test:**
- **F**astened to land (attachment method)
- **I**ntent to improve (not just personal use)
- **X** extent of attachment (removal would damage)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Trade fixtures (business equipment) remain personal property
- Mortgagee rights to fixtures attached during mortgage term
- Intent controls over method of attachment

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Tenant installs custom kitchen cabinets. → Become fixtures, transfer with property.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Factory installs machinery on bolts. → Trade fixtures, removable by tenant.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Homeowner attaches custom lighting fixture with permanent wiring. → Fixture; removal would damage walls.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Mortgage recorded; homeowner later installs expensive pool. → Pool becomes security for mortgage.

**Magic Words:**
- **Trade fixtures** = removable by tenant
- **Annexation intent** = key to fixture status
- **Provided that** = removal doesn't damage property
- **Mortgage secures** = fixtures attached during term

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Personal vs. real property
2. **Rule:** Apply FIX test
3. **Exception:** Trade fixture or mortgage rights

**FIX Test Application:**
- **Fastened:** Method of attachment (bolts, cement, wiring)
- **Intent:** To permanently improve the realty (not temporary)
- **Extent:** Removal would cause substantial damage to property
- **Control Factor:** Intent trumps attachment method

**Trade Fixtures Rules:**
- **Business equipment:** Installed for commercial use
- **Tenant's property:** Belongs to tenant, not landlord
- **Removal rights:** Tenant can remove before lease ends
- **Damage limitation:** Must repair any damage from removal
- **Notice:** Often required before removal

**Mortgagee Rights:**
- **After-acquired property:** Fixtures attached during mortgage term
- **Security interest:** Mortgage secures the fixtures
- **Priority:** Mortgagee's interest superior to later creditors
- **Recording:** Mortgage must be recorded to protect priority

**Severance Doctrine:**
- **Removal:** Taking fixture off the land
- **Restores personalty:** [MBE Split] Some states allow restoration
- **Mortgage rights:** May still be subject to mortgage lien
- **Third parties:** Bona fide purchasers may take free of lien

**Special Fixtures:**
- **Agricultural:** Special rules for farming equipment
- **Tenant improvements:** May become landlord's property
- **Construction materials:** Become fixtures when incorporated
- **Ornamental:** Intent determines fixture status

**Trap Radar:**
- Intent controls over attachment method
- Severance doesn't always restore personal property status
- Mortgage secures fixtures attached during term
- Agricultural fixtures may have special rules
- Building materials become fixtures when incorporated
- Trade fixtures must be removed before lease ends
- Mortgagee's rights extend to fixtures attached during term
- Removal of fixtures may trigger mortgage default
- Intent to permanently improve is key inquiry
- Temporary attachments usually remain personal property

- **Groundwater:** [MBE Split] Rule of capture vs. reasonable use

**Mnemonic: "WATER" Rights:**
- **W**estern states (appropriation)
- **A**ctual use required
- **T**itle by beneficial use
- **E**astern states (riparian)
- **R**easonable use doctrine

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Eastern vs. Western water law doctrines
- Reasonable use doesn't allow waste
- Groundwater rules vary by jurisdiction

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** California landowner diverts water for irrigation. → Valid under prior appropriation if first user.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** New York riparian owner uses all stream water. → Invalid; must leave reasonable amount for downstream users.

**Magic Words:**
- **First in time** = first in right (appropriation)
- **Reasonable use** = no unreasonable harm (riparian)
- **Provided that** = beneficial use requirement

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Eastern (riparian) vs. Western (appropriation) jurisdiction
2. **Rule:** Apply reasonable use or first in time
3. **Exception:** Groundwater special rules

**Trap Radar:**
- Riparian rights attach to land bordering water
- Prior appropriation requires actual diversion and beneficial use
- Reasonable use doctrine prevents waste and harm
- Groundwater "rule of capture" in many states
- Surface water vs. groundwater different rules

## 11. MINERAL RIGHTS & OIL/GAS LAW

**Rule (17 words):** Mineral rights can be severed from surface; royalty interests and working interests have different rights.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Severance:** Minerals can be separated from surface
- **Royalty Interest:** Right to share in production proceeds

- **Implied Covenants:** Duty to develop and protect wells
- **Waste Prevention:** Duty to prevent drainage

**Mnemonic: "MINE" Rights:**
- **M**ineral rights severable
- **I**mplied covenants to develop
- **N**o waste doctrine
- **E**xecution for breach

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Royalty vs. working interest rights

- Surface owner's rights after severance

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor reserves "all oil and gas" in deed. → Minerals severed from surface ownership.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Royalty owner sues for non-development. → Breach of implied covenant of reasonable development.

**Magic Words:**
- **Royalty interest** = share in production, no development duty
- **Working interest** = exploration rights, development duty
- **Provided that** = reasonable development required

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Royalty vs. working interest
2. **Rule:** Apply severance and development duties
3. **Exception:** Surface use restrictions

**Trap Radar:**
- Mineral rights automatically sever unless reserved
- Implied covenants include further exploration and marketability
- Waste includes premature abandonment and spacing violations
- Surface owner retains rights to use surface after severance
- Pooling and unitization can combine small interests

---

## 12. SPECIAL PROPERTY INTERESTS

**Rule (16 words):** Future advances, option contracts, and rights of first refusal create enforceable property interests.

**Major Subtopics:**

- **C**ontracts (options, ROFR)
- **E**quitable enforcement

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Options must be supported by consideration
- Rights of first refusal triggered by bona fide offers
- Future advances clauses in mortgages

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Contract gives buyer option to purchase within 6 months. → Enforceable if supported by consideration.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Seller promises to sell to buyer before others. → Right of first refusal; no automatic purchase duty.

**Magic Words:**
- **Option contract** = irrevocable offer for specified time
- **Right of first refusal** = match bona fide offers
- **Provided that** = consideration supports enforceability

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Type of special interest
2. **Rule:** Check consideration and triggering events
3. **Exception:** Statute of frauds requirements

**Trap Radar:**
- Options require separate consideration beyond purchase price
- ROFR triggered only by arms-length bona fide offers
- Future advances must be within mortgage amount limits
- Profit à prendre can be in gross or appurtenant
- Equitable servitudes require notice to bind successors

## 13. EMINENT DOMAIN & INVERSE CONDEMNATION

**Rule (18 words):** Government can take private property for public use with just compensation; inverse condemnation occurs without formal proceedings.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Public Use:** Broad interpretation since Kelo
- **Just Compensation:** Fair market value
- **Inverse Condemnation:** Government action damaging property

- **E**minent domain power

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Kelo decision allows economic development takings
- Inverse condemnation doesn't require physical taking
- Compensation includes consequential damages

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** City condemns home for highway. → Valid public use; just compensation required.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Government action causes flooding damaging property. → Inverse condemnation; compensation due.

**Magic Words:**
- **Public use** = government project (broad interpretation)
- **Just compensation** = fair market value
- **Provided that** = due process followed

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Direct taking vs. inverse condemnation
2. **Rule:** Check public use and compensation
3. **Exception:** Police power regulations

**Trap Radar:**
- Kelo allows economic development takings
- Inverse condemnation requires substantial damage
- Compensation includes business losses and moving expenses
- Partial takings require compensation for remainder value loss
- Due process requires notice and hearing
- Private property rights protected by 5th Amendment

**Magic Word Patterns:**
- "So long as" + condition = always determinable
- "But if" + condition = always condition subsequent  
- "To A's heirs" = always reversion to grantor
- "Joint tenants" + severance = always tenancy in common

**Fact Pattern Templates:**
- Recording: O→A (record?), O→B (notice?), who wins?
- Estates: Grantor conveys "language," what interests created?
- LL-T: Landlord breaches, tenant remedies available?
- AP: Possessor uses land (HATE elements?), gains title?

**Question Type Recognition:**
- **"What interest does X have?"** = Estate classification
- **"Who wins under the recording act?"** = BFP analysis  
- **"Can the covenant be enforced?"** = Running analysis
- **"What remedies are available?"** = Breach consequences

### **📊 Error Analysis System**

**Mistake Categories:**
1. **Rule Confusion:** Didn't know the black letter law
2. **Fact Misreading:** Missed key facts in the hypo

- Easements ↔ Covenants (both run with land)
- Zoning ↔ Takings (government regulation)

**"Six Degrees of Property":**
Practice connecting any two topics in 6 steps or fewer:
- Fixtures → Mortgages → Recording → BFP → Notice → Easements

### **💡 Active Recall Techniques**

**The "Question Creation" Method:**
- Create your own MBE questions for each topic
- Focus on the trickiest distinctions
- Trade questions with study partners

### **🎨 Creative Memory Palaces**

**The Property Law Law Firm:**
- Reception = Estates (first thing clients discuss)
- Conference Room = Conveyancing (where deals happen)
- Hallways = Easements (pathways through building)
- Partner Offices = Concurrent Ownership (shared spaces)
- Tenant Floors = Landlord-Tenant (rental space)
- Vault = Mortgages (where security is kept)
- City Planning Department = Zoning (government floor)
- Security Office = Adverse Possession (border patrol)
- Storage Room = Fixtures (what belongs where)

**Journey Through Your Property:**
Create a mental walk through a property you know well, placing each legal concept at specific locations you'll remember.

### **⚡ Speed Recognition Drills**

**Flash Recognition (30 seconds each):**
- Show granting language → identify estate type

- Race-Notice → BFP who records first without notice wins

**Adverse Possession (HATE):**
- Hostile → Without permission
- Actual → Physical possession
- Exclusive → No sharing
- Continuous → Statutory period

**Estates:**
- "For life" → Life estate
- "So long as" → Fee simple determinable
- "But if" → Fee simple subject to condition subsequent
- "Provided that" + third party → Executory limitation

**Concurrent Ownership:**
- 4 unities → Joint tenancy
- Missing unity → Tenancy in common
- Married + 4 unities → Tenancy by entirety (if recognized)

**Fixtures (FIX):**
- Fastened + Intent + eXtent → Fixture
- Trade fixture → Remains personal property
