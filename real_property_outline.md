## 1. ESTATES & FUTURE INTERESTS

**Rule (22 words):** Present possessory estates include fee simple absolute, defeasible fees, and life estates; future interests include reversions, remainders, and executory interests that must satisfy RAP.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Fee Simple Absolute:** "To A and heirs" - lasts forever, most comprehensive estate
- **Life Estates:** Measured by life of holder or another (pur autre vie)
- **Defeasible Fees:** Determinable, subject to condition subsequent, executory limitation
- **Future Interests:** Reversions, remainders (vested/contingent), executory interests
- **Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP):** Must vest within 21 years of life in being
- **Class Gifts:** "To A's children" - vests immediately but interests contingent

**Mnemonic: "PREFUR" Elements:**
- **P**resent possessory estate (now)
- **R**emainder (to third party after life estate)
- **E**xecutory interest (springs on condition)
- **F**ee simple defeasible (determinable/subject to/executory limitation)
- **U**ltimate reversion (back to grantor)
- **R**ule against perpetuities (21-year limit)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Confusing fee simple determinable ("until X happens") vs. subject to condition subsequent ("can be taken back if X")
- Forgetting remainders must be contingent or vested, never executory
- RAP: "Lives in being" + 21 years + period of gestation

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor conveys "to A for life, then to B." → A has life estate, B has vested remainder.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Grantor conveys "to A so long as A never marries." → A has fee simple determinable; grantor retains possibility of reverter.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** "To A for life, then to A's children." → A has life estate; children have contingent remainder.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** "To A for life, then to A's heirs." → A has life estate; "heirs" creates reversion to grantor.

**Magic Words:**
- **So long as** = fee simple determinable (automatic termination)
- **But if** = subject to condition subsequent (manual reentry required)
- **Provided that** = executory limitation (automatic transfer to third party)
- **Then to** = remainder (after life estate ends)
- **Remainder to** = future interest in third party

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as present (now) or future (later) interest
2. **Rule:** Apply PREPUR elements to determine exact type
3. **Exception:** Check RAP validity for contingent interests

**RAP Application:**
- **Lives in being:** People alive when interest created + unborn children
- **21 years:** After death of last life in being
- **Period of gestation:** 280 days for unborn children
- **Wait and see doctrine:** [MBE Split] Some states save interests that vest within period

**Trap Radar:**
- "To A and his heirs" = fee simple (words of inheritance not required)
- Life estate pur autre vie (measured by another's life) is valid
- Class gifts to "children" vest immediately but interests remain contingent
- "Heirs" in granting clause = reversion, not remainder
- Shifting executory interest (benefits original grantor) vs. springing (benefits third party)
- RAP doesn't apply to vested interests or options to purchase
- "To A, but if A dies without issue, to B" = executory interest in B
- Charitable trusts and governmental interests exempt from RAP

## 2. CONVEYANCING & RECORDING

**Rule (20 words):** Recording statutes protect bona fide purchasers; race-notice is majority rule, requiring timely recordation without notice of prior interests.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Deed Types:** Warranty, special warranty, bargain & sale, quitclaim
- **Marketable Title:** Insurable title free of reasonable defects
- **Title Insurance:** Protects against title defects and off-record risks
- **After-Acquired Title:** Doctrine that validates defective conveyances
- **Recording Acts:** Race, notice, race-notice (majority)
- **Chain of Title:** Must examine entire chain for breaks

**Mnemonic: "RACE" Recording Acts:**
- **R**ace (first to record wins, no notice inquiry)
- **A**ctual notice (bars protection regardless of recordation)
- **C**onstructive notice (recorded documents provide notice)
- **E**xception: wild deeds and forged instruments

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Bona fide purchaser status requires good faith + value + no notice
- Chain of title doctrine (must examine entire chain, not just immediate grantor)
- Notice includes actual, constructive, and inquiry notice

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** O conveys to A; A records. O then conveys to BFP who records without notice. → BFP wins under race-notice.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** O conveys to A; A doesn't record. O conveys to B who knows of A's interest. → A wins; B has notice.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Warranty deed covenants seisin, quiet enjoyment, warranty, further assurances. → Full protection against title defects.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Quitclaim deed transfers "whatever interest I have." → No warranties, buyer takes risk.

**Magic Words:**
- **Bona fide purchaser** = good faith + value + no notice
- **So long as** = race-notice protection applies
- **Provided that** = notice (actual/constructive) defeats protection
- **Warranty deed** = covenants against title defects
- **Quitclaim deed** = no warranties, "as is"

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify recording act (race/notice/race-notice)
2. **Rule:** Check BFP elements and timing
3. **Exception:** Notice or wild deed destroys protection

**Deed Validity Checklist:**
- Grantor competency and ownership
- Delivery and acceptance (intent to convey)
- Adequate description of property
- Consideration (not required but common)
- Signature (witnesses/notarization may be required)

**Recording Act Variations:**
- **Race:** First to record wins (Arkansas)
- **Notice:** No notice protects (Louisiana)
- **Race-notice:** First to record without notice wins (majority)

**Trap Radar:**
- Mortgage recording doesn't always protect priority (depends on jurisdiction)
- "Notice" includes actual knowledge, inquiry notice, and record notice
- Forged deeds are void, not voidable (even BFP can't claim)
- Delivery + acceptance required for deed validity
- Seal not required in most states
- After-acquired title doctrine validates defective deeds
- Title insurance covers off-record risks and survey defects
- Marketable title acts extinguish ancient claims

## 3. EASEMENTS, SERVITUDES & LICENSES

**Rule (21 words):** Easements create rights to use another's land; appurtenant easements run with land, in gross are personal; licenses are revocable permissions.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Appurtenant Easements:** Benefit dominant estate, run with land
- **Easements in Gross:** Personal to holder, don't run with land
- **Affirmative Easements:** Right to use (crossing, drainage)
- **Negative Easements:** Right to prevent use (light, air, support)
- **Creation Methods:** Express, prescription, implication, estoppel
- **Termination:** Merger, abandonment, release, prescription, condemnation
- **Scope of Rights:** Limited to original purpose and necessity

**Mnemonic: "EASE" Creation Methods:**
- **E**xpress (written agreement)
- **A**dverse use (prescription: hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous)
- **S**tatutory implication (necessity or prior use)
- **E**stoppel (detrimental reliance)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Appurtenant easements require dominant/servient estates; in gross easements benefit individuals
- Termination by merger, abandonment, release, or condemnation
- Scope limited to original purpose and necessity

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor conveys land with "right to cross Grantor's adjacent lot." → Appurtenant easement created.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway for 20 years openly. → Prescriptive easement if all elements met.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Landlocked parcel; owner gains easement by necessity across neighbor's land. → Implied easement by necessity.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Utility company has easement in gross for power lines. → Doesn't run with company's land transfers.

**Magic Words:**
- **Appurtenant to** = runs with dominant estate
- **In gross** = personal to holder, doesn't run
- **Provided that** = all prescription elements satisfied
- **Way of necessity** = easement by implication for landlocked parcels

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as easement (property interest) vs. license (personal)
2. **Rule:** Check creation method and type (appurtenant/in gross)
3. **Exception:** Termination methods or statute of limitations

**Creation Methods Detail:**
- **Express:** Must be in writing; oral agreements = license
- **Prescription:** Hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous, statutory period
- **Implication:** Prior use + continuous + reasonable necessity
- **Estoppel:** Promise + reasonable reliance + injustice to deny

**Termination Methods:**
- **Merger:** Same person owns both dominant and servient estates
- **Abandonment:** Non-use + intent to abandon (affirmative acts help)
- **Release:** Written relinquishment of easement rights
- **Prescription:** Adverse use against easement holder
- **Condemnation:** Government takes easement for public use

**Trap Radar:**
- Affirmative easements (right to do something) vs. negative (right to prevent)
- Easements by implication require strict necessity
- "Way of necessity" arises from landlocked parcels
- Written requirement for express easements (oral = license)
- Scope limited to original purpose and necessity
- Negative easements harder to establish (writing usually required)
- Utility easements often in gross (personal to utility)
- Easement scope determined by original intent and necessity
- "Floating easements" shift with land development

## 4. CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP

**Rule (20 words):** Joint tenancy requires four unities; tenancy in common has no survivorship; tenancy by entirety protects marital property from separate creditors.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Joint Tenancy:** Right of survivorship, four unities required
- **Tenancy in Common:** No survivorship, unequal shares allowed
- **Tenancy by Entirety:** Marital property, creditor protection
- **Severance:** Methods that destroy joint tenancy
- **Partition:** Court-ordered division (in kind or by sale)
- **Creditor Rights:** Against joint tenant interests

**Mnemonic: "TIE" Unities:**
- **T**ime (same moment acquired)
- **I**nterest (equal shares)
- **E**ntirety (whole property undivided)
- Plus **P**ossession (shared use rights)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Severance destroys joint tenancy (conveyance, mortgage, or partition action)
- Presumption favors tenancy in common unless four unities proven
- Tenancy by entirety protects against separate creditors only

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** "To A and B as joint tenants." → Right of survivorship applies.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Joint tenants A and B; A conveys interest to C. → Severance; now tenancy in common.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Married owners A and B; A's creditor gets judgment. → Cannot attach to entirety property.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Joint tenants A and B; A mortgages interest. → [MBE Split] May or may not sever depending on jurisdiction.

**Magic Words:**
- **Joint tenants** = survivorship applies
- **Tenants in common** = no survivorship
- **Provided that** = all four unities present
- **Tenancy by entirety** = marital creditor protection

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Count unities present
2. **Rule:** Apply survivorship or equal shares
3. **Exception:** Severance methods destroy joint tenancy

**Severance Methods:**
- **Conveyance:** Joint tenant transfers interest to third party
- **Mortgage:** [MBE Split] Some states sever, others don't
- **Partition:** Court action terminates concurrent ownership
- **Death:** Triggers survivorship, doesn't "sever" the tenancy

**Partition Types:**
- **In kind:** Physical division of property
- **By sale:** Court orders sale, divides proceeds
- **Owelty:** Monetary adjustment for unequal division

**Creditor Rights:**
- **Joint Tenancy:** Creditor can reach debtor's interest only
- **Tenancy in Common:** Creditor can force partition and sale
- **Tenancy by Entirety:** Protected from separate creditors
- **Joint Debtor:** Both spouses liable on joint debts

**Trap Radar:**
- Partition in kind vs. partition by sale
- Creditor's rights against joint tenant's interest
- "Heirs and assigns" doesn't create joint tenancy
- Tenancy by entirety requires valid marriage
- Death of joint tenant doesn't "sever" - it triggers survivorship
- Mortgage severance [MBE Split] between jurisdictions
- Presumption of tenancy in common when unities missing
- "Joint tenancy" language doesn't overcome missing unities
- Creditor of one joint tenant cannot force partition

## 5. LANDLORD-TENANT LAW

**Rule (21 words):** Landlord must maintain habitable premises; tenant must pay rent; holdover becomes periodic tenancy; self-help eviction is illegal in most states.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Implied Warranty of Habitability:** Landlord duty to maintain safe premises
- **Quiet Enjoyment:** Right to undisturbed possession
- **Retaliatory Evictions:** Illegal to evict for exercising tenant rights
- **Security Deposits:** Limits, return requirements, deductions
- **Assignment vs. Sublease:** Transfer of lease rights
- **Holdover Tenants:** Periodic tenancy rules

**Mnemonic: "RENT" Duties:**
- **R**epairs (landlord: major; tenant: minor)
- **E**xclusive possession (quiet enjoyment)
- **N**o retaliation (for complaints)
- **T**enant duties (pay rent, reasonable care)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Implied warranty of habitability applies to residential leases
- Retaliatory eviction (evicting for exercising tenant rights) is illegal
- Security deposit rules vary by jurisdiction

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Landlord fails to fix leaky roof; tenant withholds rent. → Valid repair-and-deduct.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Tenant complains about code violations; landlord evicts. → Retaliatory eviction (invalid).
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Tenant assigns entire lease to third party. → Assignee liable to landlord; original tenant remains secondarily liable.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Month-to-month tenant holds over after lease expires. → Becomes periodic tenant; landlord can terminate with notice.

**Magic Words:**
- **Warranty of habitability** = landlord's duty to maintain
- **Quiet enjoyment** = tenant's right to undisturbed possession
- **Provided that** = tenant pays rent timely
- **Retaliatory eviction** = illegal for tenant complaints

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify breach (landlord vs. tenant duty)
2. **Rule:** Apply habitability or quiet enjoyment
3. **Exception:** Retaliatory eviction or self-help defenses

**Warranty of Habitability Elements:**
- **Structural components:** Roof, walls, floors, windows
- **Plumbing:** Working fixtures, hot water, sewage
- **Heating:** Adequate heat in winter
- **Safe conditions:** No code violations, pest-free
- **Residential only:** Doesn't apply to commercial leases

**Tenant Remedies for Breach:**
- **Repair and deduct:** Withhold rent for repairs
- **Terminate lease:** Move out and stop rent
- **Sue for damages:** Breach of contract
- **Injunctive relief:** Court order to fix problems

**Security Deposit Rules:**
- **Limits:** Usually 1-2 months' rent
- **Return time:** 30 days after lease ends
- **Deductions:** Only for actual damages
- **Interest:** [MBE Split] Some states require payment
- **Itemization:** Must provide written explanation

**Assignment vs. Sublease:**
- **Assignment:** Transfer of entire lease interest
- **Sublease:** Transfer of portion of lease term
- **Privity:** Assignment creates privity of estate with landlord
- **Liability:** Original tenant remains liable in both cases

**Trap Radar:**
- Commercial vs. residential lease standards
- "Month-to-month" presumption for periodic tenancies
- Landlord's right to re-enter for non-payment
- Tenant's abandonment requires landlord's acceptance
- Security deposit limits and return requirements
- Retaliatory eviction timing (must be within reasonable time)
- Constructive eviction requires landlord knowledge and opportunity to cure
- "Repair and deduct" requires proper notice to landlord
- Landlord cannot waive warranty of habitability

## 6. MORTGAGES, FORECLOSURE & PRIORITY

**Rule (20 words):** Mortgage creates security interest; foreclosure terminates mortgagor's equity; purchase money mortgages have super-priority over later liens on same collateral.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Mortgage vs. Deed of Trust:** Title transfer differences
- **Foreclosure Process:** Judicial vs. non-judicial
- **Deficiency Judgments:** Recovery of unpaid balance
- **Due-on-Sale Clauses:** Acceleration upon transfer
- **Purchase Money Priority:** Construction and acquisition loans
- **Junior Liens:** Survival after senior foreclosure

**Mnemonic: "MORT" Priority:**
- **M**ortgage (security interest)
- **O**riginal purchase money (highest priority)
- **R**ecordation timing (first in time, first in right)
- **T**ax liens (special priority status)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Purchase money mortgages beat subsequent liens on same property
- Mortgage doesn't transfer title (deed of trust does)
- Deficiency judgments vary by state (anti-deficiency statutes)

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Buyer borrows $100K to purchase home; later borrows $50K for renovations. → Purchase money has priority.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Buyer borrows for purchase; seller takes back mortgage. → Still purchase money priority.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Mortgage with due-on-sale; buyer transfers property. → Lender can accelerate full balance.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Senior mortgage forecloses; junior lien survives. → Junior liens usually survive senior foreclosure.

**Magic Words:**
- **Purchase money** = super-priority over junior liens
- **First in time** = first in right (absent fraud)
- **Provided that** = recorded properly
- **Due-on-sale** = acceleration clause triggered

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify lien type (purchase money vs. later)
2. **Rule:** Apply priority rules
3. **Exception:** Fraud or statutory exceptions

**Mortgage Types:**
- **Mortgage:** Security interest; borrower retains title
- **Deed of Trust:** Trustee holds title as security
- **Purchase Money:** Loan for acquisition or construction
- **Construction:** Funds used for building improvements

**Foreclosure Process:**
- **Judicial:** Court-supervised sale
- **Non-judicial:** Trustee sale (deeds of trust)
- **Strict Foreclosure:** [MBE Split] Some states allow
- **Redemption:** Right to repurchase before sale

**Deficiency Judgments:**
- **Allowed:** If foreclosure sale < debt amount
- **Anti-deficiency:** [MBE Split] Purchase money protection
- **One-action rule:** California prevents deficiency
- **Fair value:** Some states limit to fair market value

**Purchase Money Priority:**
- **Acquisition:** Loan to purchase the property
- **Construction:** Funds used for building/improvements
- **Super-priority:** Beats all subsequent liens
- **Recording:** Must be properly recorded

**Trap Radar:**
- Due-on-sale clauses triggered by transfers
- Deficiency judgments after foreclosure
- Mortgage vs. deed of trust differences
- Junior liens survive senior foreclosure
- Recording doesn't perfect unrecorded mortgages
- Purchase money priority applies to same collateral only
- Construction loans require funds used for construction
- Due-on-sale enforceable despite transfer restrictions
- Redemption rights vary by state and mortgage type

## 7. ZONING & TAKINGS

**Rule (20 words):** Zoning regulates land use; takings require just compensation; variance is exception to zoning rules for hardship; exactions must be roughly proportional.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Zoning Ordinances:** Comprehensive land use regulation
- **Variances & Special Permits:** Exceptions to zoning rules
- **Physical vs. Regulatory Takings:** Government actions requiring compensation
- **Exactions:** Development conditions (Nollan/Dolan test)
- **Inverse Condemnation:** Damages from government action
- **Substantive Due Process:** Zoning must be reasonable

**Mnemonic: "ZONE" Elements:**
- **Z**oning ordinance (comprehensive plan)
- **O**wnership rights (police power limited)
- **N**o compensation unless taking
- **E**xceptions (variance, special use permit)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Physical taking (invasion) vs. regulatory taking (diminution in value)
- Spot zoning (single parcel change) is invalid unless comprehensive
- Exactions must satisfy "rough proportionality" test

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** City zones residential; property owner gets variance for home business. → Valid if meets criteria.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** City downzones property 50% value reduction. → Possible regulatory taking requiring compensation.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** City requires park dedication for subdivision approval. → Valid exaction if roughly proportional.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Government condemns land for private project. → Invalid public use requirement.

**Magic Words:**
- **Spot zoning** = invalid unless comprehensive
- **Regulatory taking** = compensation required
- **Provided that** = legitimate government interest
- **Rough proportionality** = exaction must be related to impact

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as zoning or taking issue
2. **Rule:** Apply police power or compensation
3. **Exception:** Variance or special permit procedures

**Zoning Requirements:**
- **Comprehensive:** City-wide plan, not spot zoning
- **Reasonable:** Not arbitrary or capricious
- **Uniform:** Similar properties treated similarly
- **Due Process:** Notice and hearing requirements

**Variance Standards:**
- **Hardship:** Unique to the property
- **Not self-created:** Owner didn't cause the hardship
- **Substantial:** Significant impact on property use
- **Neighborhood:** Won't substantially affect surrounding area

**Physical Takings:**
- **Direct invasion:** Government physically occupies land
- **Permanent easement:** Continuous government use
- **Temporary:** May require compensation
- **Inverse condemnation:** Government action damages property

**Regulatory Takings:**
- **Penn Central factors:** Economic impact, investment-backed expectations, character of government action
- **Total taking:** Regulation eliminates all economic value
- **Categorical:** Certain regulations per se takings
- **Temporary:** Takings during project delays

**Exactions (Nollan/Dolan):**
- **Essential nexus:** Exaction must relate to development impact
- **Rough proportionality:** Cost reasonably related to benefit
- **Dedications:** Land or money for public improvements
- **Impact fees:** Per-unit charges for infrastructure

**Trap Radar:**
- Nollan/Dolan "rough proportionality" test
- Temporary takings during project delays
- Exactions must be related to development impact
- Moratoria don't require compensation if reasonable
- Transferable development rights
- Spot zoning invalid even if reasonable
- Regulatory takings require significant diminution in value
- Public use requirement for eminent domain
- Substantive due process limits zoning power
- Floating zones must have definite standards

## 8. ADVERSE POSSESSION

**Rule (19 words):** Hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous possession for statutory period perfects title; color of title reduces period to 7 years.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Elements Required:** HATE (hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous)
- **Color of Title:** Written document reducing statutory period
- **Tacking:** Combining successive possessors' time
- **Disabilities:** Tolling the statute (minority, insanity)
- **Boundary Disputes:** Specific rules for fence/line cases
- **Government Immunity:** Public property cannot be adversely possessed

**Mnemonic: "HATE" Elements:**
- **H**ostile (without permission)
- **A**ctual (physical possession)
- **T**ax payment (often required)
- **E**xclusive (no sharing with true owner)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Tacking (successive adverse possessors combine time)
- Color of title reduces statutory period to 7 years
- Hostile doesn't require ill intent

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Squatter openly farms vacant lot for 20 years. → Gains title by adverse possession.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway openly for 15 years. → Prescriptive easement, not adverse possession.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Parent adversely possesses for 10 years, conveys to child who continues for 8 more. → Tacking allowed; total 18 years.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Adverse possessor is mentally incompetent for 5 years during possession. → Statute tolled; total time counts.

**Magic Words:**
- **Color of title** = 7-year period
- **Tacking allowed** = combine possession periods
- **Provided that** = all elements satisfied
- **Disability tolls** = stops statute from running

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Check possession vs. easement
2. **Rule:** Verify HATE elements
3. **Exception:** Disabilities or color of title

**HATE Elements Detail:**
- **Hostile:** Without owner's permission (not ill intent)
- **Actual:** Physical use and control of the land
- **Exclusive:** Possessor treats land as their own
- **Continuous:** Uninterrupted for statutory period
- **Statutory Period:** Usually 20 years (7 with color of title)

**Color of Title Requirements:**
- **Written instrument:** Deed, will, or court order
- **Describes the land:** Adequate legal description
- **In chain of title:** Connects to adverse possessor's claim
- **Reduces period:** From 20 to 7 years in most states

**Tacking Rules:**
- **Privity of estate:** Successor must get interest from prior possessor
- **Same hostile claim:** Continuous adverse use under same theory
- **No breaks:** Each possessor must satisfy elements
- **Disabilities:** Don't prevent tacking

**Disabilities That Toll:**
- **Minority:** Under age of majority (usually 18)
- **Insanity:** Mental incapacity preventing legal action
- **Imprisonment:** [MBE Split] Some states toll for prisoners
- **War:** Military service may toll statute

**Boundary Disputes:**
- **Good faith improvement:** Reliance on survey or monuments
- **AGREED boundaries:** Lines established by neighbors
- **Adverse possession:** Shorter period (often 10 years)
- **Color of title:** Not required for boundary disputes

**Trap Radar:**
- Hostile doesn't require ill intent (just without permission)
- "Claim of right" not required in many jurisdictions
- Disabilities (minority, insanity) toll statute
- Government property immune to adverse possession
- Boundary disputes require specific elements
- Color of title must be in possessor's chain of title
- Tacking requires privity between successive possessors
- "Open and notorious" is presumed if no interruption
- Disabilities toll only during the disability period
- Tax payment not required in all jurisdictions

## 9. FIXTURES

**Rule (18 words):** Personal property becomes real property when permanently attached with intent to improve the realty; trade fixtures remain personal property.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **FIX Test:** Fastened + Intent + eXtent of attachment
- **Trade Fixtures:** Business equipment removable by tenant
- **Mortgage Rights:** Fixtures attached during mortgage term
- **Severance:** Removal may or may not restore personal property
- **Agricultural Fixtures:** Special rules for farming equipment
- **Building Materials:** Become fixtures when incorporated

**Mnemonic: "FIX" Test:**
- **F**astened to land (attachment method)
- **I**ntent to improve (not just personal use)
- **X** extent of attachment (removal would damage)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Trade fixtures (business equipment) remain personal property
- Mortgagee rights to fixtures attached during mortgage term
- Intent controls over method of attachment

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Tenant installs custom kitchen cabinets. → Become fixtures, transfer with property.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Factory installs machinery on bolts. → Trade fixtures, removable by tenant.
**Micro-Hypo 3 (Clean):** Homeowner attaches custom lighting fixture with permanent wiring. → Fixture; removal would damage walls.
**Micro-Hypo 4 (Trap):** Mortgage recorded; homeowner later installs expensive pool. → Pool becomes security for mortgage.

**Magic Words:**
- **Trade fixtures** = removable by tenant
- **Annexation intent** = key to fixture status
- **Provided that** = removal doesn't damage property
- **Mortgage secures** = fixtures attached during term

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Personal vs. real property
2. **Rule:** Apply FIX test
3. **Exception:** Trade fixture or mortgage rights

**FIX Test Application:**
- **Fastened:** Method of attachment (bolts, cement, wiring)
- **Intent:** To permanently improve the realty (not temporary)
- **Extent:** Removal would cause substantial damage to property
- **Control Factor:** Intent trumps attachment method

**Trade Fixtures Rules:**
- **Business equipment:** Installed for commercial use
- **Tenant's property:** Belongs to tenant, not landlord
- **Removal rights:** Tenant can remove before lease ends
- **Damage limitation:** Must repair any damage from removal
- **Notice:** Often required before removal

**Mortgagee Rights:**
- **After-acquired property:** Fixtures attached during mortgage term
- **Security interest:** Mortgage secures the fixtures
- **Priority:** Mortgagee's interest superior to later creditors
- **Recording:** Mortgage must be recorded to protect priority

**Severance Doctrine:**
- **Removal:** Taking fixture off the land
- **Restores personalty:** [MBE Split] Some states allow restoration
- **Mortgage rights:** May still be subject to mortgage lien
- **Third parties:** Bona fide purchasers may take free of lien

**Special Fixtures:**
- **Agricultural:** Special rules for farming equipment
- **Tenant improvements:** May become landlord's property
- **Construction materials:** Become fixtures when incorporated
- **Ornamental:** Intent determines fixture status

**Trap Radar:**
- Intent controls over attachment method
- Severance doesn't always restore personal property status
- Mortgage secures fixtures attached during term
- Agricultural fixtures may have special rules
- Building materials become fixtures when incorporated
- Trade fixtures must be removed before lease ends
- Mortgagee's rights extend to fixtures attached during term
- Removal of fixtures may trigger mortgage default
- Intent to permanently improve is key inquiry
- Temporary attachments usually remain personal property

## 10. WATER LAW & RIPARIAN RIGHTS

**Rule (18 words):** Riparian owners have right to reasonable use of water; prior appropriation doctrine governs in western states.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Riparian Rights:** Natural watercourse rights
- **Prior Appropriation:** "First in time, first in right"
- **Reasonable Use:** No unreasonable harm to other users
- **Groundwater:** [MBE Split] Rule of capture vs. reasonable use

**Mnemonic: "WATER" Rights:**
- **W**estern states (appropriation)
- **A**ctual use required
- **T**itle by beneficial use
- **E**astern states (riparian)
- **R**easonable use doctrine

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Eastern vs. Western water law doctrines
- Reasonable use doesn't allow waste
- Groundwater rules vary by jurisdiction

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** California landowner diverts water for irrigation. → Valid under prior appropriation if first user.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** New York riparian owner uses all stream water. → Invalid; must leave reasonable amount for downstream users.

**Magic Words:**
- **First in time** = first in right (appropriation)
- **Reasonable use** = no unreasonable harm (riparian)
- **Provided that** = beneficial use requirement

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Eastern (riparian) vs. Western (appropriation) jurisdiction
2. **Rule:** Apply reasonable use or first in time
3. **Exception:** Groundwater special rules

**Trap Radar:**
- Riparian rights attach to land bordering water
- Prior appropriation requires actual diversion and beneficial use
- Reasonable use doctrine prevents waste and harm
- Groundwater "rule of capture" in many states

## 11. MINERAL RIGHTS & OIL/GAS LAW

**Rule (17 words):** Mineral rights can be severed from surface; royalty interests and working interests have different rights.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Severance:** Minerals can be separated from surface
- **Royalty Interest:** Right to share in production proceeds
- **Working Interest:** Right to explore and produce
- **Implied Covenants:** Duty to develop and protect wells
- **Waste Prevention:** Duty to prevent drainage

**Mnemonic: "MINE" Rights:**
- **M**ineral rights severable
- **I**mplied covenants to develop
- **N**o waste doctrine
- **E**xecution for breach

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Royalty vs. working interest rights
- Implied covenant of reasonable development
- Surface owner's rights after severance

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor reserves "all oil and gas" in deed. → Minerals severed from surface ownership.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Royalty owner sues for non-development. → Breach of implied covenant of reasonable development.

**Magic Words:**
- **Royalty interest** = share in production, no development duty
- **Working interest** = exploration rights, development duty
- **Provided that** = reasonable development required

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Royalty vs. working interest
2. **Rule:** Apply severance and development duties
3. **Exception:** Surface use restrictions

**Trap Radar:**
- Mineral rights automatically sever unless reserved
- Implied covenants include further exploration and marketability
- Waste includes premature abandonment and spacing violations
- Surface owner retains rights to use surface after severance
- Pooling and unitization can combine small interests

## 12. SPECIAL PROPERTY INTERESTS

**Rule (16 words):** Future advances, option contracts, and rights of first refusal create enforceable property interests.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Options to Purchase:** Irrevocable offers for specified time
- **Rights of First Refusal:** Right to match any bona fide offer
- **Future Advances:** Mortgages secure future loans
- **Equitable Servitudes:** Negative easements enforceable in equity
- **Profit à Prendre:** Right to take something from another's land

**Mnemonic: "SPICE" Interests:**
- **S**ervitudes (equitable)
- **P**rofit à prendre
- **I**nterests (future advances)
- **C**ontracts (options, ROFR)
- **E**quitable enforcement

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Options must be supported by consideration
- Rights of first refusal triggered by bona fide offers
- Future advances clauses in mortgages

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Contract gives buyer option to purchase within 6 months. → Enforceable if supported by consideration.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Seller promises to sell to buyer before others. → Right of first refusal; no automatic purchase duty.

**Magic Words:**
- **Option contract** = irrevocable offer for specified time
- **Right of first refusal** = match bona fide offers
- **Provided that** = consideration supports enforceability

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Type of special interest
2. **Rule:** Check consideration and triggering events
3. **Exception:** Statute of frauds requirements

**Trap Radar:**
- Options require separate consideration beyond purchase price
- ROFR triggered only by arms-length bona fide offers
- Future advances must be within mortgage amount limits
- Profit à prendre can be in gross or appurtenant
- Equitable servitudes require notice to bind successors

## 13. EMINENT DOMAIN & INVERSE CONDEMNATION

**Rule (18 words):** Government can take private property for public use with just compensation; inverse condemnation occurs without formal proceedings.

**Major Subtopics:**
- **Public Use:** Broad interpretation since Kelo
- **Just Compensation:** Fair market value
- **Inverse Condemnation:** Government action damaging property
- **Partial Takings:** Compensation for diminished value
- **Project Influence:** Damages from project proximity

**Mnemonic: "TAKE" Elements:**
- **T**aking must be for public use
- **A**ctual taking or damaging
- **K**elo broadened public use
- **E**minent domain power

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Kelo decision allows economic development takings
- Inverse condemnation doesn't require physical taking
- Compensation includes consequential damages

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** City condemns home for highway. → Valid public use; just compensation required.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Government action causes flooding damaging property. → Inverse condemnation; compensation due.

**Magic Words:**
- **Public use** = government project (broad interpretation)
- **Just compensation** = fair market value
- **Provided that** = due process followed

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Direct taking vs. inverse condemnation
2. **Rule:** Check public use and compensation
3. **Exception:** Police power regulations

**Trap Radar:**
- Kelo allows economic development takings
- Inverse condemnation requires substantial damage
- Compensation includes business losses and moving expenses
- Partial takings require compensation for remainder value loss
- Due process requires notice and hearing
- Private property rights protected by 5th Amendment
