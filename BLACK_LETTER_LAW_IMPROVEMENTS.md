- **Word count range:** 19-25 words per rule for optimal memorization

5. **Bar exam focused:** Rules emphasize distinctions and elements commonly tested

## Integration with Existing Systems

The expanded headline rules complement the existing black letter law database:
- **Database:** 114 detailed rules across 7 subjects in JSON format
- **Headline rules:** 100 condensed rules for quick review
- **Tutoring systems:** Both resources used by bar exam tutoring tools in the repository

## Usage Recommendations

### For Quick Review
1. Review headline rules daily before studying detailed materials
2. Use word counts for self-testing (cover rule, try to recall in ~20 words)
3. Focus on one subject at a time for 15-20 minute review sessions

### For Active Recall
1. Read topic name only
2. Try to recall the rule from memory
3. Check your answer
4. Note rules that need additional study

### For Exam Preparation
1. Use as a final review checklist before practice exams
2. Review rules from subjects where you scored lowest
3. Create flashcards from rules that are difficult to memorize

## Files Modified
