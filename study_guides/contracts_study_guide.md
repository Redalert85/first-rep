# 📋 Contracts Study Guide
*Master formation, performance, and remedies for the MBE*

---

## 🎯 MASTER LEARNING FRAMEWORK
**Always analyze Contracts fact patterns using these prompts:**
- **Is there a contract?** (Offer, acceptance, consideration, intent)
- **What governs?** (Common law vs UCC Article 2)
- **Has performance occurred?** (Conditions, breach, excuse)
- **What remedies apply?** (Expectation, reliance, restitution, specific performance)
- **Are there defenses?** (SOF, illegality, mistake, capacity)
- **Do third parties have rights?** (Assignments, third-party beneficiaries)

## 📚 QUICK NAVIGATION
| Priority | Topic | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH | Formation, Performance, Remedies | Most tested: offer/acceptance, perfect tender, damages |
| ⭐⭐ MEDIUM | Defenses, UCC risk of loss, warranties | Frequent traps, memorize structure |
| ⭐ LOW | Third-party issues, accord & satisfaction | Know basics, drill mnemonics |

## 🛠️ PROVEN STUDY METHOD
1. **Preview** (5 min): Review mnemonics and high-yield table.
2. **Learn** (20 min): Study outline with visuals and story.
3. **Apply** (15 min): Work through micro-hypos.
4. **Lock In** (5 min): Recite mnemonics and test yourself.
5. **Space** (24h+): Revisit with practice questions / flashcards.

## 🧠 CORE RULE (24 words)
Contracts enforce bargained-for agreements formed with offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent, subject to defenses, conditions, and remedies for breach.

## 🎭 STORY METHOD – "Deal Summit"
Imagine a business school atrium where parties negotiate at tables, drafting terms, checking consideration, and planning for breach fallout.

## 🧱 MAJOR TOPIC ARCHITECTURE
1. Formation (Offer, Acceptance, Consideration)
2. Contract Terms & Interpretation (UCC vs Common Law)
3. Performance, Breach, and Conditions
4. Remedies & Damages
5. Defenses to Enforcement
6. Third-Party Rights

---

## 1. FORMATION – FOCI CHECKLIST
- **Offer**: Manifestation of willingness to enter bargain.
- **Consideration**: Bargained-for exchange (benefit/detriment). Adequate unless nominal; preexisting duty rule applies (CL).
- **Intent**: Objective manifestations control; ads usually invitations.
- **Acceptance**: CL mirror-image; UCC permissive with additional terms depending on merchant status; mailbox rule.

**Traps & Rules**
- Option contracts (need consideration unless UCC firm offer ≤ 3 months, signed by merchant).
- Mailbox rule exceptions: option, improperly addressed, rejection before acceptance.
- Illusory promises not enforceable.

**Mnemonic**: `FOCI` – Offer, Consideration, Intent, Acceptance.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. Revocation received before acceptance → no contract.
2. Option contract: acceptance effective upon receipt, not dispatch.
3. Illusory promise (“as many as I want”) → no consideration.

---

## 2. TERMS & INTERPRETATION
- **Common Law**: Mirror-image; counteroffer rejects.
- **UCC Battle of Forms**: Acceptance with additional/different terms; between merchants, additional terms included unless (i) materially alter, (ii) offer expressly limits acceptance, (iii) objection.
- **Gap Fillers**: Price (reasonable), time (reasonable), place (seller’s location), payment (due at delivery).
- **Parol Evidence Rule**: Final writing controls; exceptions for ambiguity, fraud, subsequent modification, collateral agreements.
- **Course Hierarchy (UCC)**: Express > Course of performance > Course of dealing > Usage of trade.

**Traps**
- Parol evidence cannot contradict fully integrated writing.
- “No oral modification” clauses enforceable under UCC.

---

## 3. PERFORMANCE, BREACH, CONDITIONS
- **Common Law**: Substantial performance; material breach allows withholding.
- **UCC**: Perfect tender rule; single delivery → reject for any nonconformity; installment contracts → substantial impairment.
- **Conditions**: Precedent vs subsequent; express must be strictly satisfied.
- **Anticipatory Repudiation**: Unequivocal refusal before performance due; non-breaching party may sue, suspend, or demand adequate assurance. Retraction allowed before reliance if no cancellation.
- **Adequate Assurances**: UCC allows written demand if reasonable insecurity; 30-day response window.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. Substantial performance with minor defect → damages for deficiency, but no rescission.
2. Installment delivery with minor defect cured → rejection improper.
3. Party demands assurance, none given in 30 days → anticipatory repudiation.

---

## 4. REMEDIES & DAMAGES (`ERRS`)
- **Expectation**: Place P where performance would.
- **Reliance**: Reimburse expenses.
- **Restitution**: Value of benefit conferred.
- **Specific Performance**: Unique goods/real property; not for personal services (only injunction).

**UCC Damages**
- Buyer Cover: (Cover − K) + incidental + consequential − expenses saved.
- Buyer Market: (Market price − K) + incidental + consequential.
- Buyer Accepted Goods: (Value as warranted − as accepted) + incidental + consequential.
- Seller Resale: (K − Resale) + incidental.
- Seller Market: (K − Market) + incidental.
- Seller Lost Volume: Profit + incidental (must show capacity, profitability, would have made sale).
- Seller Price Action: For goods accepted, risk of loss transferred, or specially manufactured.

**Limits**: Foreseeability (Hadley), certainty, mitigation (employment, cover).
- Liquidated damages valid if difficult to estimate, reasonable prediction.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. Lost volume seller (car dealership) → lost profit.
2. Contractor 80% complete; owner breaches → expected profit + costs incurred.
3. Invalid penalty clause → unenforceable; use actual damages.

---

## 5. DEFENSES (`STUPID`)
- **Statute of Frauds**: Writing signed by party to be charged for Ks not performable within 1 year, marriage, surety, goods ≥ $500 (UCC), land, executor promises.
- **Unconscionability**: Procedural + substantive; UCC allows court to limit or void.
- **Duress**: Wrongful threat; economic duress if no reasonable alternative.
- **Illegality/Public Policy**: Void to extent of illegality.
- **Mistake**: Mutual (material + basic assumption + risk not assumed); unilateral if non-mistaken party knew or enforcement unconscionable.
- **Impossibility/Impracticability/Frustration**: Supervening event; basic assumption; no fault; no risk allocation.
- **Capacity/Infancy**: Minor can disaffirm; liable for necessities.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. Oral land sale w/ partial performance → enforceable despite SOF (possession + payment).
2. Government prohibition after K → impossibility.
3. One-party mistake known to other → rescission possible.

---

## 6. THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS
- **Intended Beneficiaries**: Rights vest upon assent, suit, or reliance. Promisor can assert defenses against promisee.
- **Assignments**: Transfers rights; for value = irrevocable; gratuitous revocable unless writing delivered. Multiple assignments (majority/Restatement: last bona fide purchaser wins; minority: first assignment wins).
- **Delegations**: Transfer duties. Delegator remains liable unless novation; delegatee liable if assumption of duties.
- **Accord & Satisfaction**: Substitute performance agreement (accord) + completion (satisfaction). Failure → can sue on original or accord.
- **Novation**: All parties agree to substitute; original obligor released.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. Intended beneficiary relies → rights vest.
2. Gratuitous assignment revoked by subsequent assignment → second revokes.
3. Delegatee assumes duties → obligee may sue delegatee.

---

## 7. UCC DELIVERY, TITLE & RISK OF LOSS
- Agreement controls first (FOB shipment vs destination terms).
- Breaching party bears risk until cure/acceptance.
- Merchant sellers pass risk on buyer’s **receipt**; non-merchant sellers upon tender.
- Casualty to identified goods before risk passes voids K.
- Entrustment allows merchant to transfer good title to buyer in ordinary course.
- Voidable title in hands of defrauder → can pass good title to good-faith purchaser.

**Micro-Hypos**
1. FOB Dallas; goods destroyed after carrier delivery → buyer bears risk.
2. Merchant seller ships nonconforming goods; buyer rejects → seller bears risk.
3. Goods destroyed before risk passes, K not yet performed → contract avoided.

---

## 8. ACCEPTANCE, REJECTION & REVOCATION (UCC)
- Acceptance via: acknowledging conformity, failing to reject in reasonable time, behaving inconsistently with seller’s ownership.
- Rejection must be timely; buyer must hold goods with reasonable care.
- Revocation of acceptance allowed when nonconformity substantially impairs value and difficulty of discovery or reliance on cure.
- Right to inspect before acceptance unless COD.
- Adequate assurances available when reasonable grounds for insecurity; failure to respond within 30 days = repudiation.

---

## 9. EXCUSE: IMPOSSIBILITY / IMPRACTICABILITY / FRUSTRATION
- Trigger: supervening event, basic assumption, no fault, risk not assumed.
- UCC: commercial impracticability; extreme shortages due to unforeseen events.
- Partial impracticability → allocate fairly among customers, give notice.
- Frustration: principal purpose substantially frustrated.
- Increased cost alone insufficient unless extreme/unreasonable.

---

## 10. MODIFICATION, NOVATION, ACCORD
- **Modification**: CL needs new consideration unless unforeseen; UCC good faith, no consideration required.
- **Accord & Satisfaction**: Performance of accord discharges original duty; failure allows suit on original or accord.
- **Novation**: All parties agree to substitute; original party discharged.

---

## 11. WARRANTIES (UCC & COMMON)
- **Express**: Any affirmation, description, sample basis of bargain.
- **Implied Merchantability**: Merchant sellers; fit for ordinary purpose.
- **Implied Fitness**: Seller knows specific purpose; buyer relies.
- **Disclaimer**: Express hard to disclaim; merchantability must mention term and be conspicuous; fitness must be conspicuous writing; “as is” works.
- **Limitations**: Cannot fail of essential purpose; personal injury limitations unconscionable in consumer goods.
- **Privity/Tort overlap**: Modern trend extends to foreseeable users; strict products liability overlaps.

## 🧪 PRACTICE PROMPTS
1. Merchant seller ships conforming goods; buyer wrongfully rejects and they’re destroyed in storm. Who bears loss?
2. Contractor learns steel price tripled due to unforeseen embargo; what doctrine applies?
3. Buyer uses goods for a month, then discovers hidden defect. Requirements for revocation?
4. Seller disclaimers “as is”; later gives detailed sample description. Warranty effect?
5. Third-party beneficiary sues promisor after reliance—what defenses?
