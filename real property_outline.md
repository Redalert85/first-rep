## 1. ESTATES & FUTURE INTERESTS

**Rule (18 words):** Present possessory estates include fee simple absolute, defeasible fees, and life estates; future interests include reversions, remainders, and executory interests.

**Mnemonic: "PREFUR" Elements:**
- **P**resent possessory estate
- **R**emainder (to third party)
- **E**xecutory interest (springs on condition)
- **F**ee simple defeasible (determinable/subject to/executory limitation)
- **U**ltimate reversion (back to grantor)
- **R**ule against perpetuities (must vest within 21 years)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Confusing fee simple determinable ("until X happens") vs. subject to condition subsequent ("can be taken back if X")
- Forgetting remainders must be contingent or vested, never executory

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor conveys "to A for life, then to B." → A has life estate, B has remainder.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Grantor conveys "to A so long as A never marries." → A has fee simple determinable; grantor retains possibility of reverter.

**Magic Words:**
- **So long as** = fee simple determinable (automatic termination)
- **But if** = subject to condition subsequent (manual reentry required)
- **Provided that** = executory limitation (automatic transfer to third party)

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as present (now) or future (later) interest
2. **Rule:** Apply PREPUR elements to determine exact type
3. **Exception:** Check RAP validity for contingent interests

**Trap Radar:**
- "To A and his heirs" = fee simple (words of inheritance not required)
- Life estate pur autre vie (measured by another's life) is valid
- Class gifts to "children" vest immediately but interests remain contingent
- "Heirs" in granting clause = reversion, not remainder
- Shifting executory interest (benefits original grantor) vs. springing (benefits third party)

## 2. CONVEYANCING & RECORDING

**Rule (19 words):** Recording statutes protect bona fide purchasers; race-notice is majority rule, requiring timely recordation without notice of prior interests.

**Mnemonic: "RACE" Recording Acts:**
- **R**ace (first to record wins, no notice inquiry)
- **A**ctual notice (bars protection regardless of recordation)
- **C**onstructive notice (recorded documents provide notice)
- **E**xception: wild deeds and forged instruments

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Bona fide purchaser status requires good faith + value + no notice
- Chain of title doctrine (must examine entire chain, not just immediate grantor)

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** O conveys to A; A records. O then conveys to BFP who records without notice. → BFP wins under race-notice.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** O conveys to A; A doesn't record. O conveys to B who knows of A's interest. → A wins; B has notice.

**Magic Words:**
- **Bona fide purchaser** = good faith + value + no notice
- **So long as** = race-notice protection applies
- **Provided that** = notice (actual/constructive) defeats protection

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify recording act (race/notice/race-notice)
2. **Rule:** Check BFP elements and timing
3. **Exception:** Notice or wild deed destroys protection

**Trap Radar:**
- Mortgage recording doesn't always protect priority (depends on jurisdiction)
- "Notice" includes actual knowledge, inquiry notice, and record notice
- Forged deeds are void, not voidable (even BFP can't claim)
- Delivery + acceptance required for deed validity
- Seal not required in most states

## 3. EASEMENTS, SERVITUDES & LICENSES

**Rule (20 words):** Easements create rights to use another's land; appurtenant easements run with land, in gross are personal; licenses are revocable permissions.

**Mnemonic: "EASE" Creation Methods:**
- **E**xpress (written agreement)
- **A**dverse use (prescription: hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous)
- **S**tatutory implication (necessity or prior use)
- **E**stoppel (detrimental reliance)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Appurtenant easements require dominant/servient estates; in gross easements benefit individuals
- Termination by merger, abandonment, release, or condemnation

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Grantor conveys land with "right to cross Grantor's adjacent lot." → Appurtenant easement created.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway for 20 years openly. → Prescriptive easement if all elements met.

**Magic Words:**
- **Appurtenant to** = runs with dominant estate
- **In gross** = personal to holder, doesn't run
- **Provided that** = all prescription elements satisfied

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as easement (property interest) vs. license (personal)
2. **Rule:** Check creation method and type (appurtenant/in gross)
3. **Exception:** Termination methods or statute of limitations

**Trap Radar:**
- Affirmative easements (right to do something) vs. negative (right to prevent)
- Easements by implication require strict necessity
- "Way of necessity" arises from landlocked parcels
- Written requirement for express easements (oral = license)
- Scope limited to original purpose and necessity

---

## 4. CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP

**Rule (19 words):** Joint tenancy requires four unities; tenancy in common has no survivorship; tenancy by entirety protects marital property.

**Mnemonic: "TIE" Unities:**
- **T**ime (same moment)
- **I**nterest (equal shares)
- **E**ntirety (whole property)
- Plus **P**ossession (shared use)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Severance destroys joint tenancy (conveyance, mortgage, or partition action)
- Presumption favors tenancy in common unless four unities proven

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** "To A and B as joint tenants." → Right of survivorship applies.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Joint tenants A and B; A conveys interest to C. → Severance; now tenancy in common.

**Magic Words:**
- **Joint tenants** = survivorship applies
- **Tenants in common** = no survivorship
- **Provided that** = all four unities present

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Count unities present
2. **Rule:** Apply survivorship or equal shares
3. **Exception:** Severance methods destroy joint tenancy

**Trap Radar:**
- Partition in kind vs. partition by sale
- Creditor's rights against joint tenant's interest
- "Heirs and assigns" doesn't create joint tenancy
- Tenancy by entirety requires valid marriage
- Death of joint tenant doesn't "sever" - it triggers survivorship

---

## 5. LANDLORD-TENANT LAW

**Rule (20 words):** Landlord must maintain habitable premises; tenant must pay rent; holdover becomes periodic tenancy; self-help eviction is illegal.

**Mnemonic: "RENT" Duties:**
- **R**epairs (landlord: major; tenant: minor)
- **E**xclusive possession (quiet enjoyment)
- **N**o retaliation (for complaints)
- **T**enant duties (pay rent, reasonable care)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Implied warranty of habitability applies to residential leases
- Retaliatory eviction (evicting for exercising tenant rights) is illegal

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Landlord fails to fix leaky roof; tenant withholds rent. → Valid repair-and-deduct.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Tenant complains about code violations; landlord evicts. → Retaliatory eviction (invalid).

**Magic Words:**
- **Warranty of habitability** = landlord's duty to maintain
- **Quiet enjoyment** = tenant's right to undisturbed possession
- **Provided that** = tenant pays rent timely

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify breach (landlord vs. tenant duty)
2. **Rule:** Apply habitability or quiet enjoyment
3. **Exception:** Retaliatory eviction or self-help defenses

**Trap Radar:**
- Commercial vs. residential lease standards
- "Month-to-month" presumption for periodic tenancies
- Landlord's right to re-enter for non-payment
- Tenant's abandonment requires landlord's acceptance
- Security deposit limits and return requirements

---

## 6. MORTGAGES, FORECLOSURE & PRIORITY

**Rule (19 words):** Mortgage creates security interest; foreclosure terminates mortgagor's equity; purchase money mortgages have super-priority over later liens.

**Mnemonic: "MORT" Priority:**
- **M**ortgage (security interest)
- **O**riginal purchase money (highest priority)
- **R**ecordation timing (first in time, first in right)
- **T**ax liens (special priority status)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Purchase money mortgages beat subsequent liens on same property
- Mortgage doesn't transfer title (deed of trust does)

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Buyer borrows $100K to purchase home; later borrows $50K for renovations. → Purchase money has priority.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Buyer borrows for purchase; seller takes back mortgage. → Still purchase money priority.

**Magic Words:**
- **Purchase money** = super-priority over junior liens
- **First in time** = first in right (absent fraud)
- **Provided that** = recorded properly

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Identify lien type (purchase money vs. later)
2. **Rule:** Apply priority rules
3. **Exception:** Fraud or statutory exceptions

**Trap Radar:**
- Due-on-sale clauses triggered by transfers
- Deficiency judgments after foreclosure
- Mortgage vs. deed of trust differences
- Junior liens survive senior foreclosure
- Recording doesn't perfect unrecorded mortgages

## 7. ZONING & TAKINGS

**Rule (19 words):** Zoning regulates land use; takings require just compensation; variance is exception to zoning rules for hardship.

**Mnemonic: "ZONE" Elements:**
- **Z**oning ordinance (comprehensive plan)
- **O**wnership rights (police power limited)
- **N**o compensation unless taking
- **E**xceptions (variance, special use permit)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Physical taking (invasion) vs. regulatory taking (diminution in value)
- Spot zoning (single parcel change) is invalid unless comprehensive

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** City zones residential; property owner gets variance for home business. → Valid if meets criteria.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** City downzones property 50% value reduction. → Possible regulatory taking requiring compensation.

**Magic Words:**
- **Spot zoning** = invalid unless comprehensive
- **Regulatory taking** = compensation required
- **Provided that** = legitimate government interest

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Classify as zoning or taking issue
2. **Rule:** Apply police power or compensation
3. **Exception:** Variance or special permit procedures

**Trap Radar:**
- Nollan/Dolan "rough proportionality" test
- Temporary takings during project delays
- Exactions must be related to development impact
- Moratoria don't require compensation if reasonable
- Transferable development rights

---

## 8. ADVERSE POSSESSION

**Rule (18 words):** Hostile, actual, exclusive, continuous possession for statutory period perfects title against true owner.

**Mnemonic: "HATE" Elements:**
- **H**ostile (without permission)
- **A**ctual (physical possession)
- **T**ax payment (often required)
- **E**xclusive (no sharing with true owner)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Tacking (successive adverse possessors combine time)
- Color of title reduces statutory period to 7 years

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Squatter openly farms vacant lot for 20 years. → Gains title by adverse possession.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Neighbor uses your driveway openly for 15 years. → Prescriptive easement, not adverse possession.

**Magic Words:**
- **Color of title** = 7-year period
- **Tacking allowed** = combine possession periods
- **Provided that** = all elements satisfied

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Check possession vs. easement
2. **Rule:** Verify HATE elements
3. **Exception:** Disabilities or color of title

**Trap Radar:**
- Hostile doesn't require ill intent (just without permission)
- "Claim of right" not required in many jurisdictions
- Disabilities (minority, insanity) toll statute
- Government property immune to adverse possession
- Boundary disputes require specific elements

## 9. FIXTURES

**Rule (17 words):** Personal property becomes real property when permanently attached with intent to improve the realty.

**Mnemonic: "FIX" Test:**
- **F**astened to land (attachment method)
- **I**ntent to improve (not just personal use)
- **X** extent of attachment (removal would damage)

**Most-Tested Pitfalls:**
- Trade fixtures (business equipment) remain personal property
- Mortgagee rights to fixtures attached during mortgage term

**Micro-Hypo 1 (Clean):** Tenant installs custom kitchen cabinets. → Become fixtures, transfer with property.
**Micro-Hypo 2 (Trap):** Factory installs machinery on bolts. → Trade fixtures, removable by tenant.

**Magic Words:**
- **Trade fixtures** = removable by tenant
- **Annexation intent** = key to fixture status
- **Provided that** = removal doesn't damage property

**3-Step Drill:**
1. **Bucket:** Personal vs. real property
2. **Rule:** Apply FIX test
3. **Exception:** Trade fixture or mortgage rights

**Trap Radar:**
- Intent controls over attachment method
- Severance doesn't always restore personal property status
- Mortgage secures fixtures attached during term
- Agricultural fixtures may have special rules
- Building materials become fixtures when incorporated
