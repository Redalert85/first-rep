## 🔑 FOUNDATIONAL AXIOMS: TITLE AND DEEDS IN REAL PROPERTY LAW

### 1. FOUNDATIONAL AXIOMS
- **Irreducible Legal Principles**: The concept of title in real property law refers to the legal right to own, use, and transfer property. A deed is a formal document that conveys title from one party to another.
- **Fundamental Rights/Duties**: The rights of ownership (including the right to possess, use, and exclude others) and the duty to respect the rights of others (including the duty to disclose encumbrances).

### 2. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
- **Key Cases**:
  - *Pierson v. Post* (1805): Established the principle of possession as a basis for title in the context of wild animals.
  - *Johnson v. M'Intosh* (1823): Addressed the issue of land title in the context of Native American land rights, establishing the doctrine of discovery.
- **Evolution**: The common law developed through case law and statutes, such as the Statute of Frauds (1677), which required certain property transactions to be in writing.
- **Constitutional Foundations**: The Fifth Amendment protects against the taking of private property without just compensation, reinforcing the importance of title.

### 3. LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE
- **Major Premise(s)**: Title to real property can be acquired through various means, including purchase, inheritance, gift, or adverse possession.
- **Minor Premise(s)**:
  - A deed must be executed with the requisite formalities (e.g., written, signed, and delivered) to convey title.
  - Different types of deeds (e.g., warranty deed, quitclaim deed) provide varying levels of protection and guarantees regarding the title.
- **Necessary Logical Conclusions**: The type of deed used affects the rights and remedies available to the grantee in case of title disputes.

### 4. ANALOGICAL FRAMEWORK
- **Distinguishing Cases**:
  - *Shelley's Case* (1581) vs. *The Rule Against Perpetuities*: Both address future interests but differ in their application to property conveyances.
- **Similar Doctrines**:
  - Title vs. Possession: Title refers to legal ownership, while possession refers to physical control. A person can possess property without holding title (e.g., a tenant).
- **Borderline Applications**: The distinction between a gift and a sale can affect the nature of the deed and the rights conferred.

### 5. POLICY UNDERPINNINGS
- **Efficiency Rationales**: Clear title promotes marketability and encourages investment in real property, facilitating economic growth.
- **Equity Considerations**: Protecting bona fide purchasers who acquire property without notice of defects in title promotes fairness in transactions.
- **Societal Goals and Limitations**: Ensuring that property rights are respected supports social stability, but overly rigid title systems can hinder access to property.

### 6. MODERN INTERPRETATION
- **Current Trends**: The rise of electronic deeds and blockchain technology is reshaping how titles are recorded and transferred.
- **Jurisdictional Variations**: Different states have varying statutes regarding the requirements for deeds and the implications of title insurance.
- **Emerging Issues**: The impact of environmental regulations and zoning laws on property rights and title disputes is increasingly relevant.

### 7. PEDAGOGICAL AIDS
- **Mnemonic Device**: "DREAM" - Deed, Rights, Execution, Acknowledgment, Marketability.
- **Common Student Misconceptions**: Confusing title with possession; assuming all deeds provide the same level of protection.
- **"If/Then" Framework**:
  - If a deed is executed properly (written, signed, delivered), then title is conveyed.
  - If a warranty deed is used, then the grantor guarantees clear title against defects.

### Bar Exam Relevance
Understanding real property titles and deeds is crucial for bar exam questions related to property transactions, title disputes, and the implications of different types of deeds. Familiarity with foundational cases and principles will aid in analyzing hypothetical scenarios effectively.

1. **Fee Simple Absolute**: What two magic words create this estate?
2. **Defeasible Fees**: How do you distinguish "determinable" from "condition subsequent"?
3. **Concurrent Estates**: Who pays for necessary repairs in a tenancy in common?

### 📋 SECTION ROADMAP & CHECKLIST
**Time Estimate**: 45 minutes | **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ | **Exam Weight**: 60%
- [ ] **Fee Simple Absolute** - The default estate (5 min)
- [ ] **Limited Fee Estates** - DSE defeasible fees (10 min)
- [ ] **Life Estates** - For life + waste doctrine (8 min)

- [ ] **Rule Against Perpetuities** - The 21-year rule (5 min)
- [ ] **Concurrent Estates** - Joint tenancy, TIC, tenancy by entirety (5 min)

### A. PRESENT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS (Current Rights to Use Land)

#### 1. **Fee Simple Absolute** → Complete Ownership Forever
- **Plain English**: You own it completely with no strings attached
- **Memory Aid**: "Fee Simple = Free and Simple"
- **Key Point**: Lasts forever, can be sold, inherited, or given away freely

#### ⭐⭐⭐ **2. Limited Fee Estates** → Ownership That Can End

**QUICK START**: Defeasible fees are like "breakable" ownership - they can end if conditions aren't met.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Defeasible Fee Decision Tree</strong></summary>

**VISUAL ROADMAP**:
```
Start with "To A" deed
         ↓
     Any conditions?
     Yes → Check grantor rights
         ↓
Grantor must ACT to reclaim? → No: Determinable Fee
                           → Yes: Condition Subsequent
     ↓
Third party gets it? → Yes: Executory Interest
```

| **Fee Type** | **When It Ends** | **Who Gets Property** | **Grantor Action?** | **Key Clue in Deed** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Determinable** | Condition fails | Grantor (auto) | ❌ No | "so long as" |
| **Subsequent** | Condition broken | Grantor (must sue) | ✅ Yes | "but if" + "may re-enter" |
| **Executory** | Condition occurs | Third party | ❌ No | "then to [other party]" |

**🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION**:
- **Determinable/Subsequent**: Grantor gets it back (possibility of reverter vs. right of entry)
- **Executory**: Someone else gets it (divests current owner)

**Real-World Illustration**: A farmer sells land "so long as it's used for agriculture." If the buyer opens a factory, the farmer automatically gets the land back (determinable fee).

**Another Example**: A mother deeds her house "to my daughter, but if she ever divorces, I may re-enter." If the daughter divorces, the mother must sue to get the house back (condition subsequent).
</details>

**PRACTICE DRILL** 🔰 Beginner Level:
1. *"To A and heirs, so long as used for farming"* → **Determinable**
2. *"To A, but if A sells alcohol, grantor may re-enter"* → **Condition Subsequent**
3. *"To A, but if A divorces, then to A's ex-spouse"* → **Executory**

**Self-Test**: Create your own defeasible fee deed and classify it.

**Check for Understanding**: Explain the difference between possibility of reverter and right of entry in one sentence each.

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Possibility of Reverter**: Automatically returns to grantor when determinable fee condition fails.
**Right of Entry**: Grantor must take legal action to reclaim property when condition subsequent is breached.
</details>

### ⚖️ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS EXERCISE
**Compare**: Determinable Fee vs. Fee Subject to Condition Subsequent

| Aspect | Determinable Fee | Condition Subsequent |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Deed Language** | "so long as..." | "but if... may re-enter" |
| **Grantor Action** | Automatic | Must sue |
| **Future Interest** | Possibility of reverter | Right of entry |
| **Timing** | Instant on breach | After legal action |

**Question**: Which would you recommend to a client who wants to donate land to a school but retain some control? Why?

### 👥 CLIENT COUNSELING SCENARIO
**Client**: "I want to give my farm to my son for his lifetime, but I'm worried he'll neglect it. What can I do?"

**Your Response**: Consider these options:

1. **Life Estate with Possibility of Reverter**: "To son for life, but if he stops farming, property reverts to you automatically"

2. **Life Estate with Right of Entry**: "To son, but if he neglects the property, you can sue to terminate his life estate"

3. **Life Estate with Conditions**: "To son for life, provided he maintains the property as a working farm"

**Which would you recommend and why?**

---

#### 3. **Life Estate** → Ownership for Someone's Lifetime

**QUICK START**: Life estates are temporary ownership - they end when someone dies.

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 Click to Expand: Life Estate Details</strong></summary>

**a. Types of Life Estates**
- **Conventional Life Estate**: "For life of the owner" (e.g., "To A for A's life")
- **Life Estate Pur Autre Vie**: "For life of another person" (e.g., "To A for B's life")

**b. Life Tenant's Rights & Duties**
- **Rights**: Use and enjoy the property, receive income
- **Duties**: Don't commit waste (damage the property's value)
- **Memory Aid**: "Waste = Wasting the property's future value"

**Types of Waste**:
- **Voluntary Waste**: Active damage (e.g., cutting down trees for timber)
  - *Exception*: Open mines doctrine allows using existing mines
- **Permissive Waste**: Letting property deteriorate (e.g., not fixing leaks)
- **Ameliorative Waste**: Making improvements that decrease market value
  - *Modern View*: Often allowed if beneficial overall

</details>

**Check for Understanding**: Draft a sentence defining ameliorative waste and note when it is allowed.

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Ameliorative waste** is when a life tenant makes improvements that increase the property's value but change its fundamental character. It's generally allowed in modern law because the improvements benefit the future interest holder.
</details>

### 👥 CLIENT COUNSELING SCENARIO
**Client**: "I want to give my farm to my son for his lifetime, but I'm worried he'll neglect it. What can I do?"

**Your Response**: Consider these options:

1. **Life Estate with Possibility of Reverter**: "To son for life, but if he stops farming, property reverts to you automatically"

2. **Life Estate with Right of Entry**: "To son, but if he neglects the property, you can sue to terminate his life estate"

3. **Life Estate with Conditions**: "To son for life, provided he maintains the property as a working farm"

**Which would you recommend and why?**

#### 4. **Fixed-Term Tenancies** → Ownership for Specific Periods

- **Estate for Years**: Fixed period (e.g., "for 5 years")
- **Periodic Estate**: Renews automatically (e.g., "month-to-month")
- **Estate at Will**: No fixed term, ends anytime
- **Tenancy at Sufferance**: Holding over without permission (temporary)
- **Memory Aid**: "Years > Periodic > At Will > At Sufferance" (increasingly unstable)

> **Habit to Build**: After each subsection, write a one-sentence rule statement and a one-sentence application example.

**Check for Understanding**: What notice is required to end a month-to-month periodic tenancy?

---

### ⭐⭐⭐ **B. FUTURE INTERESTS** (Rights That Haven't Started Yet)

**QUICK START**: Future interests are like backup plans for property - they activate when the current ownership ends or conditions change.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Future Interests Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**MASTER CONCEPT**: Future interests are like "property time bombs" - they explode either when the current estate ends OR when a condition occurs.

**VISUAL TIMELINE**:
```
Present Estate (A owns now)
        ↓
    ┌───┴───┐
    │       │
"Waits"     "Cuts short"
    ↓          ↓
Remainder     Executory
(Reversion)
```

#### **1. Reversionary Interests** → Grantor Gets It Back ⭐⭐
- **Example**: "To A for life" (grantor automatically gets reversion)
- **Key**: Default future interest when grantor doesn't specify otherwise
- **Timing**: Kicks in when current estate ends naturally

#### **2. Remainders** → Third Party Gets It Later ⭐⭐⭐
- **Vested Remainder**: Definitely will happen
  - **Indefeasibly Vested**: Locked in forever (e.g., "then to B")
  - **Vested Subject to Open**: Can add more people (e.g., "then to B's children")
- **Contingent Remainder**: Might not happen (condition must be met)

**REMAINDER FORMULA**: "To A [current estate], then to B [remainder]"
- **Vested**: B is alive and condition (if any) is satisfied
- **Contingent**: B might not exist yet or condition not met

#### **3. Executory Interests** → "But If" Clauses ⭐⭐⭐
- **Example**: "To A, but if A dies without children, then to charity"
- **Key**: Divests (cuts short) the current owner's interest
- **Types**:
  - **Shifting**: "But if X, then to Y" (transfers to different person)
  - **Springing**: "But if X, then to grantor" (transfers back to grantor)

**🚨 TRAP ALERT**: Remainders wait patiently. Executory interests are impatient and cut in line!

**Real-Life Example**: "To my wife for life, then to my children." The children have a vested remainder - they will definitely get the property when the wife dies.

**Another Example**: "To my business partner, but if he sells the business, then back to me." This creates a springing executory interest that cuts short the partner's ownership if he sells.

**CLASSIFICATION DRILL** 🔰 Beginner Level:
1. *"To A for life, then to B"* → **Vested Remainder** (B gets it when A dies)
2. *"To A, but if A has no kids, then to charity"* → **Executory Interest** (cuts short A's ownership)
3. *"To A for life"* (no "then" clause) → **Reversion** (grantor gets it back)

**Cross-Reference**: Compare executory interests here with defeasible fees in Section A.2 - both can cut short ownership!

**Self-Test**: In "To A for life, then to A's first child," what type of remainder does the child have?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Contingent remainder** - the child must be born for the remainder to vest, so it's conditional.
</details>

</details>

---

### ⚠️ PREREQUISITE CHECKPOINT
**Before studying RAP, ensure you understand:**
- [ ] Vested vs. Contingent remainders
- [ ] The difference between remainders and executory interests
- [ ] Lives in being concept

**If you're not solid on these, review sections A-B first!**

### I. RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES → The "21-Year Time Bomb" ⭐⭐

**QUICK START**: RAP prevents property from being tied up forever - future interests must vest within 21 years after everyone alive when the interest was created dies.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: RAP Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**WHY IT EXISTS**: Prevents wealthy people from controlling property forever after death ("dead hand control").

**THE RULE IN 60 SECONDS**:
- Future interests must vest (become certain) within **21 years** after death of all **lives in being**
- **Lives in being**: People alive when the interest was created who could affect vesting
- **Clock starts**: When the future interest is created
- **Exempt**: Vested remainders, charitable gifts, commercial interests

**RAP DECISION TREE**:
```
Future interest identified?
        ↓
    Is it contingent?
    Yes → Apply RAP
        ↓
   Lives in being?
        ↓
Could vesting take >21 years?
Yes → VOID (unless reformed)
```

**✅ RAP 5-STEP CHECKLIST**:
1. **Spot the interest**: Is it contingent? (vested = usually OK)
2. **Find lives in being**: Who must live/die for vesting to occur?
3. **Worst case scenario**: Assume babies born immediately, people live long
4. **21-year clock**: Will it definitely vest/fail within 21 years after all lives die?
5. **Verdict**: Too late = void (but check for reforms!)

**PRACTICE SCENARIOS**:
1. *"To A for life, then to A's grandchildren"* → **OK** (grandchildren must be born within A's lifetime)
2. *"To A's descendants 100 years from now"* → **VOID** (could take forever)
3. *"To charity if A dies without children"* → **OK** (charitable exception)

**Real-World Case**: A wealthy businessman creates a trust "for my grandchildren, but only if they graduate from Harvard by age 25." This RAP-violates because the condition could take more than 21 years after the last grandchild's birth.

**Another Example**: "To my children for life, then to their children who reach age 21." This is OK because the remainders vest when the children are born and reach 21 within a reasonable time.

**🚨 COMMON PITFALLS**:
- Forgetting unborn potential children
- Not considering "vested subject to open" remainders
- Missing modern "wait and see" reforms in some states

**Self-Test**: Is "to my grandchildren, but only if they graduate college" RAP-valid?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**No** - could take >21 years after lives in being die.
</details>

**Cross-Reference**: RAP only applies to contingent future interests. Review vested remainders in Section B.2 for comparison.

### ⚖️ CASE BRIEF TEMPLATE
**Case Name**: [Hypothetical or Real Case]
**Key Facts**: [Bullet points of essential facts]
**Issue**: [What legal question must be answered?]
**Rule**: [State the relevant legal rule]
**Application**: [How does the rule apply to these facts?]
**Conclusion**: [What should the outcome be?]

**Practice Example**: Brief a hypothetical involving adverse possession elements.

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Sample Brief</strong></summary>

**Case Name**: *Johnson v. Smith* (Adverse Possession Case)

**Key Facts**:
- Johnson openly farmed a 5-acre parcel for 25 years
- Land was owned by Smith, who lived out of state
- Smith never visited the property or objected to Johnson's use
- Johnson paid property taxes under his name for 20 years

**Issue**: Has Johnson acquired title to the property through adverse possession?

**Rule**: Adverse possession requires actual, hostile, exclusive, continuous, and notorious possession for the statutory period (20 years in this jurisdiction), with color of title shortening the period to 7 years.

**Application**: Johnson physically possessed the land (actual), without permission (hostile), as his own (exclusive), for 25 continuous years (continuous), and it was visible to others (notorious). His payment of taxes and open farming made his possession obvious. The 25-year period exceeds the 20-year statutory requirement.

**Conclusion**: Yes, Johnson has acquired title through adverse possession. Smith slept on his rights too long.
</details>

</details>

---

### D. RULE AGAINST RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION → Can't Prevent Selling
- **General Rule**: Can't completely prevent transfer of property
- **Valid Restraints**: Limited restrictions okay on life estates
- **Invalid**: Absolute bans on selling fee simple property
- **Options & First Refusals**: Usually okay (gives chance to buy back)
- **Memory Aid**: "Can't chain the land forever"

**Check for Understanding**: Give an example of a valid restraint on a life estate.

---

### E. ADVERSE POSSESSION → "Squatter's Rights" ⭐⭐

**QUICK START**: Adverse possession allows someone to gain legal title to land by openly possessing it for a statutory period, even without the owner's permission.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Adverse Possession Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**WHY IT EXISTS**: Rewards productive use of land and punishes neglectful owners who sleep on their rights.

**CLASSIC ELEMENTS** (Must prove ALL to gain title):
1. **Actual Entry**: Physical possession and control of the land
2. **Hostile/Exclusive**: Without permission, treating land as your own
3. **Open/Notorious**: Visible and obvious to the true owner
4. **Continuous**: Uninterrupted possession for the entire statutory period
5. **Statutory Period**: Varies by state (typically 5-20 years for wild land)

**Hostile Means**: Without permission (adverse to the true owner's interest)
- **Color of Title**: Claimant has defective deed → shorter statute (7 years vs. 20)
- **Without Color of Title**: No deed → full statutory period required

**TACKING**: Multiple adverse possessors can combine their time periods if they are in privity (related by blood, marriage, or transfer).

**DEFENSES** (True owner can use to defeat claim):
- **Disability**: Owner was under legal disability (minority, insanity) during possession
- **Government Ownership**: Can't adversely possess against government
- **Good Faith Improvements**: Some states protect good faith improvers
- **Recorded Notice**: Some states have "notice statutes"

**PRACTICE SCENARIO**: Neighbor builds fence and gardens on your land for 15 years. Can they claim adverse possession?
- **Analysis**: Check elements - actual entry ✅, hostile ✅, open ✅, continuous ✅, statutory period ✅ → Yes, if in jurisdiction with 10+ year statute.

**Key Case Reference**: *Van Valkenburgh v. Lutz* (1952) - Established the "hostile" element means without permission, not necessarily unfriendly.

**EXAM TRAP**: Adverse possession is about **hostility to the true owner**, not necessarily being unfriendly!

**Self-Test**: What element is missing if someone secretly uses your land but you never know about it?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Open/Notorious** - the use must be visible and obvious to the true owner.
</details>

**Policy Rationale**: Encourages land development and prevents landowners from being lazy about protecting their rights.

</details>

---

### H. EASEMENTS, COVENANTS & COMMON SCHEMES → Rights in Another's Land ⭐⭐

**QUICK START**: Easements give you the right to use someone else's land (driveway rights). Covenants restrict what you can do with your own land (no commercial use). Common schemes and equitable servitudes knit subdivisions together—Lot 1 can be bound even if its deed is silent if the buyer had notice of the plan.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Easements & Covenants Deep Dive</strong></summary>

#### **1. EASEMENTS** → Non-Possessory Rights to Use Land
**CREATION METHODS**:
- **Express Grant**: Written agreement ("I grant you a right to cross my land")
- **Implied**: Necessity (landlocked parcel) or prior use (driveway existed before division)
- **Prescription**: Adverse use for statutory period (like adverse possession but for right-of-way)
- **By Estoppel**: Promise to grant easement, other party relies on it

**TYPES OF EASEMENTS**:
- **Appurtenant**: Benefits a particular parcel (runs with the land)
- **In Gross**: Benefits a person/organization (doesn't run with land)
- **Affirmative**: Right to DO something (cross land, draw water)
- **Negative**: Right to PREVENT something (block neighbor's view, prevent building)

**TERMINATION**:
- **Merger**: Owner acquires both easement and servient estate
- **Release**: Easement holder voluntarily gives it up
- **Abandonment**: Clear intent to stop using + non-use for statutory period
- **Prescription**: Dominant owner prevents use for statutory period

#### **2. COVENANTS & EQUITABLE SERVITUDES** → Promises About Land Use
**REAL COVENANTS** (Enforceable at law):
- **Writing**: Must be in writing
- **Intent**: Parties must intend it to run with the land
- **Touch & Concern**: Must affect land use/value
- **Notice**: Subsequent buyer must have notice
- **Horizontal Privity**: Original parties must be in privity
- **Vertical Privity**: Burden must run to successor, benefit to successor

**EQUITABLE SERVITUDES** (Enforceable in equity):
- **Same elements** as real covenants, but no need for privity
- **Implied Covenants**: From common plan or reciprocal servitudes
- **Defenses**: Changed conditions, unreasonable restraint, merger

**EXAM SCENARIO**: Developer sells lots with covenant "no commercial use." Can buyer enforce against later buyer?
- **Analysis**: Check real covenant elements - writing ✅, intent ✅, touch & concern ✅, notice ✅, privity ✅ → Yes enforceable.

#### **3. COMMON SCHEME & IMPLIED EQUITABLE SERVITUDES** → Binding Restrictions Without Express Language

**IRIS Memory Hook:**
- **I**ntent to impose on all lots (developer's master plan) ✅
- **R**estrictive promise (negative servitude) ✅
- **I**nquiry/actual/record notice to the buyer ✅
- **S**ame **S**cheme across subdivision ✅

**Story Method — "The Master-Planned Cul-de-Sac":** Imagine a developer who writes the rules backstage and expects every house to perform the same act. Even if Lot 1's script (deed) forgot the restriction, the actor (buyer) still has to follow the choreography if they saw the identical sets, signs, or recorded rules.

**Common Scheme Pro Tips:**
- **Early Sale Trap:** Lots sold before restrictions recorded can still be bound if the scheme already existed and the buyer had notice.
- **Notice Ninja:** House signs, uniform deeds, or recorded plat maps trigger inquiry or record notice—silence in the deed isn't immunity.
- **Intent Inspector:** A few unrestricted lots reserved for gas stations? Probably no common scheme—look for intent covering *all* lots.

**Micro-Hypos:**
- *Lot 1 sold first without restriction; remaining 9 deeds say "residential only".* Buyer of Lot 1 opens clinic → Bound if developer intended a plan and buyer saw the pattern or recorded plan.
- *Buyer sees marketing brochure shouting "Exclusive single-family community" but deed is silent.* → Inquiry notice binds buyer to the restriction.
- *Developer keeps half the lots unrestricted for future commercial strip.* → No common scheme; intent requirement fails.

**Analysis Drill — Three-Step Dance:**
1. **🎯 Intent:** Did the original owner intend a uniform restriction for all lots?
2. **👀 Notice:** Did the buyer have actual, record, or inquiry notice of that scheme?
3. **🚫 Restrictive:** Is the promise negative (prohibiting conduct vs. granting use)?

If all three are yes → equitable servitude implied; enforce via injunction.

**Notice Checklist:**
- **Actual:** Buyer read the HOA booklet or deed from neighbor.
- **Record:** Restrictions filed with subdivision plat or earlier deeds in chain.
- **Inquiry:** Every house is residential with "No Businesses" signs—ask questions!

**🚨 Double Trap Alert:**
- Express covenant missing? Don't stop—run the common scheme test.
- Changed conditions defense works only when the entire neighborhood transformed, not just one corner store.

**Remedy Reminder:** Implied equitable servitudes are enforced with injunctions (equity loves uniform neighborhoods).

**Self-Test:** Explain why a doctor running a clinic in Lot 1 loses even though her deed lacked restrictions in the original hypo.
**Self-Test**: What's the difference between an easement appurtenant and easement in gross?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Appurtenant** benefits a specific parcel of land (runs with the land). **In gross** benefits a person or business (doesn't automatically transfer).
</details>

**Policy Rationale**: Allows efficient land use by separating ownership from usage rights.

### ⚖️ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: EASEMENTS vs. COVENANTS

| Aspect | Easements | Covenants |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Creation** | Express, implied, prescription | Must be in writing |
| **Runs with Land** | Appurtenant easements do | Must meet 5 requirements |
| **Scope** | Use of another's land | Restrictions on own land use |
| **Termination** | Merger, abandonment, prescription | Changed conditions, unreasonable |
| **Enforcement** | Injunctive relief | Damages or injunction |

**Question**: Which would you recommend for a landowner wanting to ensure their property stays undeveloped forever?

### K. EMINENT DOMAIN & TAKINGS → Government Takes Private Property ⭐

**QUICK START**: Government can take your property for public use, but must pay just compensation. "Public use" has expanded to include economic development.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Takings Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**WHY IT EXISTS**: Government's right to acquire private property for public benefit, balanced against individual property rights.

**TYPES OF TAKINGS**:
- **Physical Taking**: Government seizes actual possession (eminent domain)
- **Regulatory Taking**: Government regulation goes "too far" and effectively takes property
- **Inverse Condemnation**: Property owner sues government claiming regulation = taking

**CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Public Use**: Must be for legitimate public purpose (expanded to include economic development)
- **Just Compensation**: Fair market value of property taken
- **Due Process**: Notice and hearing before taking

**PHYSICAL TAKINGS** (Eminent Domain):
- **Procedure**: Government offers to buy → condemns if refused → court determines compensation
- **Compensation**: Fair market value + damages to remainder (if partial taking)
- **Special Cases**: Can take entire parcel even if only part needed

**REGULATORY TAKINGS** (Penn Central Test):
1. **Economic Impact**: Does regulation substantially interfere with property use?
2. **Investment-Backed Expectations**: Did owner reasonably expect to use property this way?
3. **Character of Government Action**: Is regulation operating like traditional taking?

**EXAM SCENARIO**: City condemns your house for highway. House worth $200K, but highway only needs half the lot. What's compensation?
- **Analysis**: Full $200K for entire parcel + severance damages to remaining land.

**Key Case Reference**: *Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York* (1978) - Established the three-factor test for regulatory takings: economic impact, investment-backed expectations, and character of government action.

**🚨 TRAP ALERT**: "Public use" now includes private development if it benefits the public economically!

**Self-Test**: What's the difference between eminent domain and inverse condemnation?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Eminent domain** is when government initiates taking. **Inverse condemnation** is when property owner sues claiming government action (regulation) effectively took their property.
</details>

**Policy Rationale**: Balances government's need for land with individual property rights. "Public use" requirement prevents abuse, while just compensation ensures fairness.

### ⚖️ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: PHYSICAL vs. REGULATORY TAKINGS

| Type | Who Initiates | Compensation | Examples | Constitutional Test |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Physical Taking** | Government | Fair market value | Highway construction | Public use + just compensation |
| **Regulatory Taking** | Government regulation | May be required | Zoning restrictions | Penn Central factors |
| **Inverse Condemnation** | Property owner sues | Fair market value | Flooding from government dam | Same as physical taking |

**Critical Question**: How do you decide if a regulation goes "too far" and becomes a taking?

</details>

### L. RECORDING STATUTES → Who Wins When Titles Conflict ⭐⭐

**QUICK START**: Recording statutes determine priority between competing claims to the same property. "First in time, first in right" - but only if properly recorded.

---

### M. ZONING & LAND USE REGULATION ⭐

**QUICK START**: Zoning laws divide land into districts (residential, commercial, industrial) and regulate how property can be used. Spot zoning and exclusionary zoning may be unconstitutional.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Zoning Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**WHY IT EXISTS**: To prevent incompatible land uses and promote orderly development. Cities need commercial areas separate from residential areas.

**TYPES OF ZONING**:
- **Euclidean Zoning**: Strict separation by use (residential, commercial, industrial)
- **Performance Zoning**: Based on impacts rather than specific uses
- **Inclusive Zoning**: Requires affordable housing in all developments

**VARIANCE vs. SPECIAL EXCEPTION**:
- **Variance**: Permission to deviate from strict zoning requirements (e.g., build closer to property line)
- **Special Exception/Conditional Use**: Permission for uses allowed in zone but subject to conditions

**CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS**:
- **Substantive Due Process**: Zoning must be rationally related to legitimate government interest
- **Equal Protection**: Can't discriminate against protected classes
- **Takings**: Overly restrictive zoning may constitute a regulatory taking

**EXAM SCENARIO**: City zones a neighborhood as residential-only, preventing homeowner from operating daycare in home. Is this constitutional?
- **Analysis**: May be valid if rationally related to protecting residential character, but must allow reasonable accommodation for disabled homeowners.

**Key Case Reference**: *Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.* (1926) - Upheld zoning as constitutional exercise of police power.

**Cross-Reference**: Compare zoning restrictions with covenants in Section E - both limit property use but covenants are private while zoning is government-imposed.

**Policy Rationale**: Balances individual property rights with community needs for planned development.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Click to Expand: Recording Statutes Deep Dive</strong></summary>

**WHY THEY EXIST**: Protect innocent buyers from secret interests in property by requiring public recording of transfers.

**THREE TYPES OF RECORDING STATUTES**:

#### **1. RACE STATUTE** (Minority - Only 3 States)
- **Rule**: First to record wins, regardless of when transaction occurred
- **Example**: A sells to B on Monday, to C on Tuesday. C records first → C wins
- **Purpose**: Encourages quick recording

#### **2. NOTICE STATUTE** (Majority Rule)
- **Rule**: Bona fide purchaser (BFP) without notice wins over unrecorded interests
- **BFP Requirements**:
  - Pays valuable consideration
  - Has no actual or constructive notice
  - Records first
- **Example**: A sells to B (unrecorded). A sells to C (BFP who records). C wins because BFP without notice.

#### **3. RACE-NOTICE STATUTE** (Most States)
- **Rule**: Combines both - BFP without notice who records first wins
- **Example**: A sells to B (unrecorded). A sells to C (BFP who records first). C wins.

**CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE** (You are deemed to know):
- **Recorded Documents**: Anything in public records
- **Physical Inspection**: Obvious facts about property (e.g., someone living there)
- **Inquiry Notice**: Facts that would make reasonable person investigate

**CHAIN OF TITLE**: Recording creates "chain" showing property ownership history.

**EXAM SCENARIO**: Seller conveys to Buyer 1 but doesn't record. Seller conveys to Buyer 2 (BFP) who records. Who wins?
- **Analysis**: Depends on statute - Race: Buyer 2 wins. Notice: Buyer 2 wins. Race-Notice: Buyer 2 wins.

**🚨 TRAP ALERT**: Recording alone doesn't create rights - it just perfects them against later buyers!

**Self-Test**: In a notice jurisdiction, can a BFP with actual notice of an unrecorded interest still prevail?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**No** - BFP must be without notice (both actual and constructive) to prevail over earlier unrecorded interests.
</details>

**Policy Rationale**: Balances protecting bona fide purchasers with discouraging secret dealings.

</details>

### ⚠️ PREREQUISITE CHECKPOINT
**Before studying concurrent estates, ensure you understand:**
- [ ] Fee simple absolute vs. defeasible fees
- [ ] Future interests (reversions, remainders, executory)
- [ ] Basic estates in land concepts

**If you're not solid on these, review sections A-B first!**

### ⭐⭐⭐ **H. SHARED OWNERSHIP (Concurrent Estates)**

### ⚡ Flash Questions
1. **Joint Tenancy**: What four words create survivorship?
2. **Severance**: How can one joint tenant destroy survivorship?
3. **Tenancy in Common**: Why do creditors love this form?

**BIG PICTURE**: Three ways strangers/family can own property together - each with different rules for death, creditors, and transfers.

| **Ownership Type** | **Magic Words** | **Survivorship?** | **One Can Transfer?** | **Death Effect** | **Best For** |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Joint Tenancy** | "joint tenants" | ✅ Yes | Severs to TIC | Last owner gets all | Family homes |
| **Tenancy by Entirety** | Married + intent | ✅ Spouses only | ❌ Both must agree | Surviving spouse | Marital property |
| **Tenancy in Common** | Default/no words | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Goes to heirs | Business partners |

**🚨 STATE ALERT**: Joint tenancy mortgage rules differ by state - always check local law!

#### **1. Joint Tenancy** → "Together Forever" Ownership
**CREATION FORMULA**: Four Unities + Intent
- **Time**: Same moment
- **Title**: Same deed/document
- **Interest**: Equal shares
- **Possession**: Equal rights to use
- **PLUS**: Express words like "joint tenants with right of survivorship"

**SEVERANCE SPECTRUM**: What breaks the joint tenancy?
| Action | Effect | Why? | State Variation? |
|--------|--------|------|------------------|
| **Actual sale** | Always severs | Ownership transfers | ❌ No |
| **Mortgage** | Usually no | Debt, not ownership | ✅ Yes (varies) |
| **Will** | Never severs | Survives death | ❌ No |
| **Murder** | Forfeits share | Criminal law | ❌ No |

**PRACTICE SCENARIO**: Three siblings own Blackacre as joint tenants. Sister mortgages her share.
- **Traditional view**: Severance → becomes tenancy in common
- **Modern view**: No severance if mortgage paid (lien dissolves)

**Self-Test**: Can a joint tenant give their share to charity in a will?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**No** - survivorship prevails; the property passes to surviving joint tenants, not according to the will.
</details>

#### **2. Tenancy by Entirety** → Married Couple Superpower ⭐⭐
**REQUIRES**: Marriage + joint ownership intent (automatic in most states for spouses)

**SUPERPOWERS**:
- **Survivorship**: Always goes to surviving spouse (will can't change this)
- **Creditor Protection**: One spouse's creditors can't touch the property
- **Severance**: Only mutual agreement OR divorce

**LIMITATIONS**: Only for married couples (no same-sex exception needed post-Obergefell)

**Self-Test**: Husband owes $100K to casino. Can they seize his interest in marital home held as tenancy by entirety?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**No** - tenancy by entirety protects against individual creditors; both spouses must agree to encumber the property.
</details>

#### **3. Tenancy in Common** → "Separate But Equal" ⭐⭐
**THE DEFAULT**: What you get when joint tenancy creation fails

**KEY FEATURES**:
- **No survivorship**: Share goes to your heirs, not co-owners
- **Unequal shares**: Can be 50/50, 70/30, whatever you agree
- **Free transfer**: Each owner can sell/mortgage their share anytime
- **Creditor friendly**: Easy for lenders to reach individual shares

**BUSINESS FAVORITE**: Corporations prefer TIC because shares can be bought/sold freely

**Self-Test**: Why would investors choose TIC over joint tenancy for a rental property?

<details>
<summary>💡 Answer</summary>
**Easier to transfer ownership interests** - TIC allows each owner to freely sell or mortgage their share without affecting others.
</details>

#### 4. **Rights of Co-Owners**
- **Possession**: All can use entire property
- **Income**: Shared equally (unless agreed otherwise)
- **Liens**: Only bind the owner's share
- **Ouster**: Kicking out co-owner = liable for their share
- **Partition**: Court can divide property if requested
  - *Restraints on partition*: Limited by agreement duration
- **Expenses**:
  - **Repairs**: All share necessary costs
  - **Improvements**: No forced contribution
  - **Taxes/Mortgages**: All share costs
- **Duty**: Fair dealing required
- **Practice Prompt**: "Co-owner pays entire mortgage—can they seek contribution?" (Answer: Yes, proportionally.)
- **Default Rule Reminder**: Courts presume tenancy in common unless intent shows otherwise.

### ⏱️ One-Minute Recap – Estates & Future Interests
- Fee simple absolute is the default; defeasible fees turn on whether forfeiture is automatic or requires action.
- Life tenants must avoid waste; remember permissive vs. voluntary vs. ameliorative.
- Future interests hinge on who holds the next stick and whether vesting is certain.
- Run the RAP quick-check any time vesting depends on future births or ages over 21.
- Joint tenancy demands the four unities; any severance converts to tenancy in common.

### 📊 SECTION MILESTONE: ESTATES & OWNERSHIP
**Quick Assessment** (Answer these before proceeding to Landlord-Tenant):

1. **Fee Types**: Can you classify any deed as fee simple, determinable, or condition subsequent?
2. **Future Interests**: Can you distinguish reversion, remainder, and executory interest?

> **📈 ADAPTIVE TIP**: If you got 2+ wrong on pre-assessment, spend extra time on those topics!

### ⭐⭐⭐ **A. TYPES OF TENANCIES**

**DECISION TREE**: What type of tenancy is created?

```
How was tenancy created?
    ↓
Written Agreement ──── Fixed Period? ──── Yes → Tenancy for Years
    ↓                                      No → Periodic Tenancy
Oral Agreement/Conduct
    ↓
Specified Duration? ── Yes → Periodic Tenancy
    ↓
No Duration ──── Landlord Consent? ── Yes → Tenancy at Will
    ↓                                    No → Tenancy at Sufferance
Holding Over
    ↓
Creates Periodic Tenancy (same terms)
```

| Tenancy Type | Duration | Creation | Termination |
|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Tenancy for Years** | Fixed period | Written/oral agreement | End of term or breach |
| **Periodic Tenancy** | Auto-renews | Express, implied, holdover | Notice required |
| **Tenancy at Will** | No fixed term | Agreement, no duration | Either party, no notice |
| **Tenancy at Sufferance** | Temporary | No permission | Immediate eviction |

**🚨 EXAM TRAP**: Holdover after fixed term usually creates periodic tenancy, not tenancy at will!

#### 1. **Fixed-Term Tenancy (Tenancy for Years)**
- **Duration**: Specific period (e.g., "1 year lease")
- **Creation**: Written or oral agreement
- **Termination**:
  - End of term (automatic)
  - Breach of lease terms
  - Mutual agreement (surrender)

#### 2. **Periodic Tenancy** → Automatically Renewing
- **Creation**:
  - Express agreement (e.g., "month-to-month")
  - Implied from conduct (paying monthly rent)
  - Holdover after lease expires
- **Termination**: Requires proper notice (usually 30 days)
- **Memory Aid**: "Periodic = Pay rent, stay on"

#### 3. **Tenancy at Will** → No Fixed Term
- **Creation**: Agreement with no duration specified
- **Termination**: Either party can end anytime (no notice needed)

#### 4. **Tenancy at Sufferance** → Temporary Holdover
- **Creation**: Holding over without landlord permission
- **Termination**: Landlord can evict immediately

**Hold-Over Doctrine**: Tenant staying after lease ends
- **Creates**: Periodic tenancy with same terms
- **Landlord Options**: Accept new tenancy or evict
- **Double Rent Jeopardy**: Can't charge double rent immediately
- **Forcible Entry Laws**: Landlord can't use self-help eviction

---

### B. LEASE AGREEMENTS

#### 1. **Lease Covenant Rules**
- **Common Law**: Covenants independent (breach of one doesn't affect others)
- **Modern Trend**: Dependent (breach can terminate entire lease)

**Common Law vs. Modern Trend Snapshot**
| Issue | Common Law | Modern Trend |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Rent vs. Repairs | Tenant must still pay rent even if landlord breaches | Material breach lets tenant suspend rent |
| Duty to Maintain | Tenant bears most repair duties | Landlord often obligated for habitability |
| Remedies | Separate suits for each breach | Interdependent duties allow termination |

**Exam Technique**: If fact pattern mentions "modern approach" or cites the URLTA (Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act), apply the modern dependent covenants rule.

### ⚖️ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: TENANT RIGHTS
**Compare**: Constructive Eviction vs. Actual Eviction vs. Partial Eviction

| Type | What Happened | Tenant Must Leave? | Rent Obligation | Notice Required |
|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Actual Eviction** | Landlord physically removes tenant | Yes | Ends | No |
| **Partial Eviction** | Landlord excludes tenant from part | No | Reduced proportionally | No |
| **Constructive Eviction** | Landlord creates unlivable conditions | Yes (if tenant leaves) | Ends | Yes - must give landlord time to fix |

**Policy Rationale**: These doctrines balance landlord property rights with tenant habitability needs, preventing "slumlord" practices.

#### 2. **Options to Purchase**
- **Requirements**: Consideration + writing (statute of frauds)
- **Exercise**: Follow option terms exactly
- **Perpetuities**: Can't extend forever
- **Enforcement**: Courts favor enforcement of valid options

#### 3. **Anti-Assignment Clauses**
- **Strict Construction**: Interpreted against landlord
- **Waiver**: Landlord can approve transfers
- **Continuing Waiver**: Approval of one transfer waives for future
- **Effect of Violation**: Transfer still valid, but breach of lease
- **Reasonableness**: Courts consider if restriction is fair

---

### C. TENANT'S DUTIES & LANDLORD'S REMEDIES

> **Risk Flag**: Most landlord-tenant exam questions hinge on whether the tenant breached duties and what remedies follow.

#### 1. **Duty to Maintain Property (Anti-Waste)**
- **Voluntary Waste**: Intentionally damaging property
- **Permissive Waste**: Failing to maintain (e.g., not fixing leaks)
- **Ameliorative Waste**: Changes that decrease value
  - **Liability**: Usually must restore original condition
  - **Modern Exception**: No liability if change increases overall value

**Strategy Tip**: Identify the type of waste first, then pair it with the matching remedy.

**Property Destruction**:
- **No Fault**: Tenant can usually terminate lease
- **If Required to Repair**: Must rebuild if lease requires it
- **Wear & Tear**: Not responsible unless lease specifies

#### 2. **Duty to Use Legally**
- **Minor Violations**: Occasional illegal use doesn't breach
- **Major Violations**: Landlord can terminate lease + sue for damages

#### 3. **Duty to Pay Rent**
- **When Due**: Per lease terms (usually monthly)
- **Security Deposits**: Limited by law (usually 1-2 months rent)
- **Termination of Rent Duty**: Effective surrender ends obligation

**Landlord Remedies for Non-Payment**:
- **Tenant Still Occupying**: Sue for rent or evict
- **Self-Help**: Distress (seize property for rent owed)
- **Abandoned Property**:
  - **Landlord Does Nothing**: Tenant owes current rent only
  - **Landlord Repossesses**: Depends if landlord accepts surrender
    - *Accepts Surrender*: Rent duty ends
    - *Reenters Without Accepting*: May still owe future rent

### D. LANDLORD'S DUTIES & TENANT'S REMEDIES

### ⚡ Flash Questions
1. What remedy follows partial eviction by the landlord?
2. How do you prove constructive eviction?
3. Name three triggers for retaliatory eviction protections.

#### 1. **Duty to Deliver Possession**
- **Requirement**: Landlord must give actual possession at start
- **Remedy**: Tenant gets damages for delay

**Check for Understanding**: Does a landlord satisfy this duty if a hold-over tenant remains in possession?

#### 2. **Quiet Enjoyment** → Right to Peaceful Use
- **Actual Eviction**: Landlord completely excludes tenant = rent excused
- **Partial Eviction**:
  - *By Landlord*: Entire rent excused
  - *By Third Party*: Rent reduced proportionally
- **Constructive Eviction**: Landlord creates unlivable conditions = tenant can leave

**Check for Understanding**: Outline the three elements needed to claim constructive eviction.

#### 3. **Implied Warranty of Habitability** → Property Must Be Livable
- **Standard**: Safe and suitable for human residence
- **Remedies**: Repair demand, rent withholding, lease termination
- **Retaliatory Eviction**: Illegal if tenant complains about habitability

**Check for Understanding**: Draft a short script for a tenant to notify landlord of a breach.

#### 4. **Fair Housing Laws**
- **Protected Classes**: Race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, families
- **Prohibited**: Discrimination in renting, advertising discriminatory preferences
- **Reasonable Accommodations**: Required for disabilities
- **Exemptions**: Small owner-occupied buildings

### 🥇 GOLD STANDARD PRACTICE DRILL

**Instructions**: For each scenario, identify the key issue, state the controlling rule, and determine the likely outcome. Click answers to check your work.

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 Practice Scenario 1: Retaliatory Eviction</strong></summary>

**Scenario**: Landlord refuses to renew a lease after tenant reports mold.

**Key Issue**: Retaliatory eviction
**Rule Statement**: Landlords cannot retaliate against tenants asserting habitability rights
**Likely Outcome**: Eviction barred; tenant may recover damages

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 Practice Scenario 2: Fair Housing Discrimination</strong></summary>

**Scenario**: Landlord refuses to rent because applicant has children.

**Key Issue**: Fair Housing Act discrimination
**Rule Statement**: Familial status is a protected class under FHA
**Likely Outcome**: Landlord liable for discrimination

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 Practice Scenario 3: Reasonable Accommodation</strong></summary>

**Scenario**: Tenant installs wheelchair ramp without permission.

**Key Issue**: Reasonable accommodation
**Rule Statement**: Landlord must allow reasonable modifications for disabilities
**Likely Outcome**: Landlord must permit with restoration agreement

</details>

### 📝 FULL IRAC ESSAY PRACTICE
**Fact Pattern**: Tenant leases apartment from Landlord. After Tenant complains about broken heater in winter, Landlord serves eviction notice citing "nuisance." Tenant sues claiming retaliatory eviction.

**Instructions**: Write a complete IRAC analysis addressing whether the eviction is retaliatory.

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Sample IRAC Response</strong></summary>

**Issue**: Is Landlord's eviction of Tenant retaliatory in violation of habitability laws?

**Rule**: Retaliatory eviction occurs when a landlord takes adverse action against a tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant has complained about habitability violations or exercised other protected rights. The purpose is to prevent landlords from intimidating tenants who report code violations.

**Application**: Here, Tenant complained about a broken heater (clear habitability issue) and Landlord immediately served an eviction notice citing "nuisance." This temporal proximity and the landlord's motivation to silence habitability complaints suggest retaliation. The burden shifts to Landlord to prove a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for eviction.

**Conclusion**: The eviction is retaliatory and should be barred. Tenant may recover damages and attorney's fees.

## 🏆 MASTER SUMMARY: Real Property Law in 5 Minutes

### **OWNERSHIP INTERESTS (Estates)**
- **Fee Simple Absolute**: Default "complete ownership" estate
- **Defeasible Fees**: DSE (Determinable, Subject to Condition Subsequent, Executory)
- **Life Estates**: For life of someone + waste restrictions
- **Future Interests**: Remainders wait, executory interests cut short
- **Adverse Possession**: 5 elements to acquire title through possession
- **Easements & Covenants**: Rights in other's land, promises about land use
- **Eminent Domain**: Government taking with just compensation
- **Recording Statutes**: Priority systems for competing title claims
- **Concurrent Estates**: Joint (survivorship), Entirety (married protection), Common (default)

### **LANDLORD-TENANT LAW**
- **Tenancy Types**: Years (fixed), Periodic (renewing), At-will (flexible), At-sufferance (wrongful holdover)
- **Hold-Over**: Usually creates periodic tenancy
- **Tenant Duties**: Pay rent, maintain property, use legally
- **Landlord Duties**: Deliver possession, provide quiet enjoyment, maintain habitability
- **Fair Housing**: Race, religion, sex, disability, familial status protections

### **EXAM SUCCESS FORMULA**
1. **Read the facts** → Ask: WHO owns WHAT for HOW LONG under WHAT CONDITIONS?
2. **Spot the issue** → Is it ownership transfer, tenant rights, or landlord duties?
3. **Apply the rule** → Use mnemonics and checklists
4. **Check for traps** → State variations, modern trends, exceptions
5. **Conclude clearly** → State outcome and reasoning

## ✅ EXAM-DAY CHECKLIST
- [ ] Can you classify any defeasible fee in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Do you know when remainders vs. executory interests apply?
- [ ] Can you explain constructive eviction elements?
- [ ] Have you practiced RAP on 5+ hypotheticals?
- [ ] Can you distinguish joint tenancy severance rules?

## ⚡ SPEED ROUND (10-Minute Drill)
1. **Waste types**: Voluntary (intentional damage), Permissive (neglect), Ameliorative (value-decreasing changes)
2. **RAP steps**: Identify contingent interest → Name lives in being → Assume worst case → 21-year clock → Verdict
3. **Assignment vs. Sublease**: Assignment transfers entire remaining term; sublease creates new tenancy for part of term
4. **Habitability defenses**: Notice required, landlord's reasonable time to cure, tenant's duty to mitigate
5. **Joint tenancy unities**: Time (same moment), Title (same document), Interest (equal), Possession (equal rights)
6. **Tenant abandonment**: Landlord must prove tenant left permanently AND landlord repossessed the premises
