**Question 1 — Conlaw | TPM/Permits | Difficulty: HARD**

**Tested rule:** Traditional public forum + unbridled discretion standard

The City of State B requires permits for demonstrations in its traditional public park.
The ordinance instructs the parks director to grant a permit unless the event would be
'inappropriate or disruptive,' without further standards. Casey applies to hold a
political rally; the director denies the permit citing 'appropriateness' concerns and
offers no alternative. A facial challenge is brought under the First Amendment. The
timeline, roles, and governing standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the precise
doctrinal element.

(A) Constitutional because time, place, and manner restrictions are valid if the city cites
disruption.

(B) Constitutional because time, place, and manner restrictions are valid if the city cites
disruption.

(C) Constitutional if applied uniformly regardless of viewpoint, even without standards.

(D) Unconstitutional: the ordinance grants unbridled discretion in a traditional public forum
and lacks narrow, objective criteria.

**Answer:** D

**Why correct:** Permit schemes in traditional public forums must have narrow, objective, and definite
standards to constrain discretion. Vague terms like 'inappropriate' vest unbridled
discretion and are facially invalid.

**Why others are wrong:** A: Content-neutral TPM rules must be guided by objective standards; 'disruption' without
criteria is insufficient.; C: Uniform application does not cure unbridled discretion.; D:
Facial invalidity arises from standardless discretion; no need to prove actual viewpoint
bias.

**Trap type:** overbreadth, wrong standard
