**Question 1 — Torts | Negligence per se | Difficulty: HARD**

**Tested rule:** Warnings don't replace remediation; ordinance may set standard

At a street food fair, vendor Rowan displays a prominent 'Caution: Wet Area' sign near a
drink station. A local ordinance requires vendors to keep walking surfaces 'reasonably
dry' and to 'promptly remedy spills.' Multiple cups spill during a rush; Rowan does not
mop for ten minutes, and a patron slips and fractures a wrist. The defense offers evidence
of full compliance with industry best-practice signage. The plaintiff sues in negligence.
The timeline, roles, and governing standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the
precise doctrinal element.

(A) No liability because compliance with industry custom defeats negligence.

(B) No liability because compliance with industry custom defeats negligence.

(C) No liability because the sign shifts the risk to patrons who proceed.

(D) Liability is likely: warnings don't replace the duty to remediate; ordinance noncompliance
supports negligence (possibly per se).

**Answer:** D

**Why correct:** Custom evidence is not conclusive; statutory/ordinance standards can establish
duty/breach. Failure to clean promptly is the breach.

**Why others are wrong:** A: Custom is relevant but not dispositive.; C: Assumption of risk requires knowing,
voluntary encounter of a specific risk; signage alone is insufficient.; D: Constructive
notice can suffice; their own station created the hazard.

**Trap type:** overbreadth, wrong standard
