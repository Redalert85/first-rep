**Question 1 — Contracts | UCC §2-205/2-207 | Difficulty: HARD**

**Tested rule:** Firm offer; battle of the forms; material alteration

Quinn, a retailer, emails a signed offer to purchase 500 widgets from Jordan, a merchant,
stating 'firm for 45 days.' Three days later, Jordan replies with a written acknowledgment
adding an arbitration clause and a slightly different delivery schedule. Jordan ships
conforming goods immediately; Quinn accepts and later sues to avoid arbitration after a
dispute. The jurisdiction follows UCC Article 2. The timeline, roles, and governing
standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the precise doctrinal element.

(A) The firm offer held the price; the additional arbitration term is a material alteration
and does not enter without express assent.

(B) All additional terms in a merchant confirmation automatically become part of the contract.

(C) The reply was a counteroffer; shipment did not create a contract.

(D) Arbitration is never a material alteration between merchants.

**Answer:** A

**Why correct:** Under §2-205 the signed firm offer is irrevocable; under §2-207, material alterations
(e.g., arbitration) do not enter absent agreement.

**Why others are wrong:** A: §2-207(2) excludes material alterations.; C: A definite and seasonable expression +
shipment forms a contract under §2-207(1).; D: Arbitration is typically treated as
material absent course of dealing or assent.

**Trap type:** wrong standard, overbreadth
