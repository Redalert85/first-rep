**Question 1 — Evidence | exception/Confrontation | Difficulty: HARD**

**Tested rule:** Out-of-court statements: excited utterance vs testimonial

Skyler was charged with assault after an altercation outside a nightclub in Hillview. A
bystander placed a frantic 911 call moments after the incident, shouting that 'Skyler just
hit someone and ran toward the alley!' Twenty minutes later, once officers had secured the
scene, the same bystander gave a calm, recorded statement at the station describing the
event in detail and responding to structured questions. At trial, the bystander is
unavailable due to a sudden illness. The prosecution seeks to admit both the 911 recording
and the later station interview. Defense objects under the hearsay rules and the
Confrontation Clause. The jurisdiction follows modern federal evidence rules and Supreme
Court precedent distinguishing testimonial from non-testimonial statements. The timeline,
roles, and governing standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the precise doctrinal
element.

(A) Admit both statements because both relate to a startling event and qualify as excited
utterances.

(B) Admit the 911 call as a non-testimonial excited utterance; exclude the station interview
as testimonial absent prior cross.

(C) Admit both statements because both relate to a startling event and qualify as excited
utterances.

(D) Exclude both statements because the declarant is unavailable and the defense cannot cross-
examine.

**Answer:** B

**Why correct:** A 911 call made for ongoing emergency assistance is typically non-testimonial and may
enter under 803(2). The structured, post-event station interview is testimonial; without a
prior opportunity to cross, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission against the
accused.

**Why others are wrong:** A: Not all statements relating to a startling event are non-testimonial; the station
interview is testimonial.; B: The Confrontation Clause bars testimonial statements, not
all hearsay; non-testimonial excited utterances can be admitted.; D: The 911 call is
generally non-testimonial; the later station interview is the one that is testimonial.
