    "question": "Discuss whether a defendant who accidentally kills someone during a lawful act is guilty of homicide.",
    "grading_keywords": ["mens rea", "actus reus", "lawful act", "criminal negligence", "involuntary manslaughter"],
    "explanation": "For homicide, the prosecution must prove that the defendant caused the death of another human being. Mens rea (criminal intent) is required for most homicides. If the killing was truly accidental during a lawful act and not due to criminal negligence, the defendant may not be guilty of homicide. However, if their actions were reckless or grossly negligent, they could be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.",
    "sample_answer": "A defendant who accidentally kills during a lawful act may not be guilty of homicide unless their actions involved criminal negligence. To be convicted, there must be both actus reus (the act of killing) and mens rea (intent or recklessness). If the act was lawful and not reckless, the defendant is not criminally liable. If the act was lawful but reckless or grossly negligent, involuntary manslaughter may apply."

    "question": "Explain the hearsay rule and its exceptions.",
    "grading_keywords": ["hearsay", "out of court statement", "truth of the matter", "exceptions", "declarant", "admissible"],
    "explanation": "Hearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls within an exception (e.g., present sense impression, excited utterance, business records). The rationale is that such statements are unreliable unless certain conditions are met.",
    "sample_answer": "The hearsay rule excludes out of court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted, unless an exception applies. Common exceptions include present sense impression, excited utterance, and business records. Statements by a declarant in court are generally admissible, while those made outside are not unless an exception applies."
