## Question 1

**Subtype:** Erie/Rules/waiver

**Tested Rule:** Erie/Hanna; valid Federal Rule on point; Rule 12(h) waiver scope

**Fact Pattern:**
In a diversity action filed in federal court in Greenfield, Parker sues Kendall for negligence. A state statute requires a pre-suit affidavit from an expert within 30 days of filing; failure mandates dismissal with prejudice. Federal Rule 11 and 26 impose different certification/disclosure regimes but do not mention this specific affidavit. The defendant answered without raising any Rule 12 defenses and later moved to dismiss for failure to file the state affidavit. The plaintiff filed the affidavit on day 45. The district court must decide whether to apply the state statute. The timeline, roles, and governing standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the precise doctrinal element.

**Options:**
(A) Apply the state affidavit requirement if it is outcome-determinative and no valid Federal Rule directly conflicts; no waiver is implicated by Rule 12 because this is not a PJ/venue defense. ← CORRECT
(B) Ignore the state statute because any Federal Rule related to pleadings automatically displaces conflicting state law.
(C) Deny dismissal because the defendant waived the defense by not raising it in the first Rule 12 response.
(D) Apply the Federal Rules only, because Erie never requires application of state procedural statutes.

**Answer:** A

**Why Correct:** Under Erie/Hanna, if there is no valid Federal Rule on point, the court applies state law that would affect outcome and discourage forum shopping. The affidavit statute likely governs. Waiver under Rule 12(h) covers PJ/venue/insufficient service, not Erie choice-of-law issues.

**Why Others Wrong:**
(C) Rule 12(h) waiver does not apply to Erie choice-of-law questions.
(D) Erie can require application of state statutes when no Federal Rule directly conflicts and the rule is substantive in effect.

**Trap Types:** jurisdiction toggle, timing, wrong standard
