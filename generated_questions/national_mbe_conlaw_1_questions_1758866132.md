## Question 1

**Subtype:** TPM/Permits

**Tested Rule:** Traditional public forum + unbridled discretion standard

**Fact Pattern:**
The City of Riverton requires permits for demonstrations in its traditional public park. The ordinance instructs the parks director to grant a permit unless the event would be 'inappropriate or disruptive,' without further standards. Harper applies to hold a political rally; the director denies the permit citing 'appropriateness' concerns and offers no alternative. A facial challenge is brought under the First Amendment. The timeline, roles, and governing standards are undisputed; the dispute turns on the precise doctrinal element.

**Options:**
(A) Constitutional because time, place, and manner restrictions are valid if the city cites disruption.
(B) Constitutional because time, place, and manner restrictions are valid if the city cites disruption.
(C) Constitutional if applied uniformly regardless of viewpoint, even without standards.
(D) Unconstitutional: the ordinance grants unbridled discretion in a traditional public forum and lacks narrow, objective criteria. ← CORRECT

**Answer:** D

**Why Correct:** Permit schemes in traditional public forums must have narrow, objective, and definite standards to constrain discretion. Vague terms like 'inappropriate' vest unbridled discretion and are facially invalid.

**Why Others Wrong:**
(A) Content-neutral TPM rules must be guided by objective standards; 'disruption' without criteria is insufficient.
(C) Uniform application does not cure unbridled discretion.

**Trap Types:** overbreadth, wrong standard
