## Contracts

### Offer and Acceptance

#### Rule: Mailbox Rule

Acceptance is effective upon dispatch when sent by mail or similar means, unless:
• The offer specifies otherwise
• The offer is for an option contract (acceptance must be received)
• A rejection was sent before the acceptance

#### Elements: Valid Offer

An offer requires:
• Manifestation of present contractual intent
• Certainty and definiteness of terms
• Communication to the offeree

Essential terms: parties, subject matter, price, quantity

#### Traps: Revocation

Common mistakes with offer revocation:
• Option contracts cannot be revoked even if supported by nominal consideration
• Firm offers under UCC (merchant signed writing, 3 months max, no consideration needed)
• Indirect revocation (offeree learns offer was revoked from reliable source)

### Consideration

#### Rule: Bargained-For Exchange

Consideration requires:
1. Something of legal value (benefit to promisor or detriment to promisee)
2. Bargained-for exchange (induces the promise and the promise induces the exchange)

#### Exceptions: Past Consideration

Past consideration is NOT valid consideration because:
• It was not induced by the promise
• Exception: Material benefit rule (some jurisdictions)
• Exception: Written promise to pay debt barred by statute of limitations

## Criminal Law

### Homicide

#### Rule: Murder vs. Manslaughter

Murder: Unlawful killing with malice aforethought
• Intent to kill
• Intent to inflict serious bodily harm
• Depraved heart (reckless indifference)
• Felony murder

Voluntary manslaughter: Intentional killing in the heat of passion with adequate provocation

#### Elements: Felony Murder

Requirements for felony murder:
• Death caused during commission or attempted commission of inherently dangerous felony
• Defendant must be guilty of underlying felony
• Death must be foreseeable result of the felony
• Death must occur before the defendant reaches place of temporary safety

Common BARRK felonies: Burglary, Arson, Rape, Robbery, Kidnapping

#### Traps: Proximate Cause

Tricky proximate cause issues:
• Death caused by police or victim in self-defense generally NOT felony murder
• Accomplice liability: death of co-felon by victim/police typically does NOT create liability
• Year and a day rule (abolished in most jurisdictions)

### Inchoate Crimes

#### Rule: Attempt

Attempt requires:
• Specific intent to commit the target crime
• Substantial step toward commission (beyond mere preparation)

Cannot attempt crimes of recklessness or negligence

#### Rule: Conspiracy

Agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime:
• Agreement (express or implied)
• Intent to agree
• Intent to achieve the objective
• Overt act in furtherance (in most jurisdictions)

Pinkerton Rule: Co-conspirator liable for all foreseeable crimes committed in furtherance
