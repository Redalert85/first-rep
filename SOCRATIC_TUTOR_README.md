## 🎯 The Problem with Traditional Tutors

Traditional "tutors" just **test** you:
- Throw questions → You guess → "Wrong! Answer is B" → Next question
- **No teaching**, just assessment
- You memorize answers without understanding **why**
- Overwhelming walls of text and data dumps
- Mechanical, impersonal experience

## 🧠 The Solution: Genuine Socratic Method

This tutor **actually teaches** using the **7-Step Socratic Method** proven effective by great law professors:

### **Step 1: 🎣 HOOK** - Activate Prior Knowledge
```
"Let me ask you something: If I promise to give you $100 as a gift,
can you sue me if I change my mind?"
```
**Creates curiosity and engages existing knowledge**

### **Step 2: 🔍 EXPLORE** - Socratic Questioning
```
Let's explore:
  • What makes some promises legally enforceable?
  • If both sides don't give something, is it an agreement?
```
**Guides you to discover principles through questioning**

### **Step 3: 📜 PRINCIPLE** - Explicit Instruction
```
━━ THE RULE ━━
CONSIDERATION = Bargained-for exchange. Each side must give something of legal value.
```
**Clear, direct presentation of the legal rule**

### **Step 4: 💡 EXAMPLES** - Concrete Applications
```
Examples:
  ✓ "I'll pay $100 if you mow my lawn" - Both sides exchange
  ✗ "I'll give you $100 as a gift" - Only one side gives
```
**Shows valid vs invalid applications before abstraction**

### **Step 5: 🧪 TEST** - Application Question
```
NOW TEST YOURSELF:
Uncle promises Nephew $5,000 as graduation gift. Nephew promises nothing. Enforceable contract?
```
**Tests understanding, not just recall**

### **Step 6: ✅ FEEDBACK** - Immediate Corrective Explanations
```
✓ Correct. This is a gift promise - no consideration because Nephew gives nothing back.

OR for wrong answers:
✗ Answer: C
Why A doesn't work: A promise alone isn't enough. You need BOTH sides to give something.
```
**Explains WHY right/wrong with specific reasoning**

### **Step 7: 🤔 DEEPEN** - Elaborative Interrogation
```
💭 Now think: What if Uncle said 'I'll give you $5,000 IF you graduate'? Different result?
```
**Forces deeper thinking and transfer to new situations**

CONCEPT 1/3: Consideration

Let me ask you something: If I promise to give you $100 as a gift,
can you sue me if I change my mind?

Think about it... [ENTER]

Let's explore:
  • What makes some promises legally enforceable and others not?
  • If both sides don't give something, is it really an agreement?

[ENTER when you've thought through these]

━━ THE RULE ━━
CONSIDERATION = Bargained-for exchange. Each side must give something of legal value.

Examples:
  ✓ "I'll pay $100 if you mow my lawn" - Both sides exchange
  ✗ "I'll give you $100 as a gift" - Only one side gives

Got it? [ENTER for question]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOW TEST YOURSELF:
Uncle promises Nephew $5,000 as graduation gift. Nephew promises nothing. Enforceable contract?

  A) Yes - clear promise
  B) Yes - graduation sufficient
  C) No - no consideration
  D) No - amount too small

Your answer: C

✓ Correct. This is a gift promise - no consideration because Nephew gives nothing back. Not bargained for.

💭 Now think: What if Uncle said 'I'll give you $5,000 IF you graduate'? Different result?

Reflect on this... [ENTER]
